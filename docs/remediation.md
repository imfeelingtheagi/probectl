# Guarded agentic remediation (S-EE5, F44)

probectl's assistant can do cross-plane root-cause analysis (S24) and simulate
the impact of a topology change (S43 what-if). S-EE5 lets it take the next step
and **propose** a remediation grounded in that analysis — and **stops there**.
**probectl never executes a remediation.** A human reviews each proposal and,
if approvals are enabled, records an **approval** — a signed, audited sign-off
that an operator carries out in their own change process. There is **no executor
anywhere in the codebase**: approving a proposal changes a row and writes an
audit entry; it never reroutes traffic, mutates a device, or touches the
network.

This is the highest-care feature in the product. It is built to the letter of
CLAUDE.md §7 guardrail 8 (*remediation is observe-only / human-gated by default;
never ship un-gated autonomous network actions*) and the project's standing rule
that **ingested data must never trigger or approve an action**.

---

## The ratified policy

These parameters were signed off by the human owner before any code was written
(the guardrail requires it). They are not defaults to be tuned away in code —
changing them is a product decision, not an engineering one.

1. **Proposal-only — there is no executor.** The lifecycle is
   `proposed → approved | rejected`. "Approve" is a recorded human authorization;
   an operator then performs the change out-of-band. probectl has **no code path
   that carries out a network action**, by construction. There is deliberately
   no `executed` state and no `Apply`/`Execute`/`Run` method on the service — a
   unit test (`TestNoExecutor`) fails the build if one is ever added. A fourth
   state, `applied`, exists only as an **operator's note** that they carried the
   suggestion out elsewhere; it changes nothing in probectl.

2. **Ingested data can never trigger or approve an action.** The AI's
   `propose_remediation` MCP tool can only ever create a `proposed` proposal.
   The *only* path to `approved` is the authenticated `POST
   /v1/remediation/proposals/{id}/approve` route, which requires a human holding
   the `remediation.approve` permission. A prompt-injection buried in telemetry
   can, at worst, cause a proposal to appear in the review queue — never an
   approval, and never an action.

3. **Advisory-only by default.** Approvals are **off** until an operator sets
   `PROBECTL_REMEDIATION_APPROVALS_ENABLED=true`. Until then the assistant still
   proposes and humans still review, but Approve is unavailable (the API returns
   `409 approvals_disabled`; the UI disables the button and shows an
   advisory-only banner).

4. **Single-admin approve.** Any authenticated principal holding
   `remediation.approve` (an admin permission) can approve. (A future
   second-approver / change-window gate can layer on without changing this
   model.)

5. **Blast-radius limited.** Every proposal carries a **dry-run** — a read-only
   S43 topology what-if that sizes how many services, prefixes, and hosts the
   change would affect. A proposal whose blast radius exceeds
   `PROBECTL_REMEDIATION_MAX_BLAST_RADIUS` (default 50) **cannot be approved**.
   An *unknown* blast radius (topology unavailable) is also blocked — **fail
   closed**. Blocked approval attempts are themselves audited.

6. **Fully audited.** Propose, approve, reject, and *blocked* approvals are
   written to the tenant's tamper-evident audit stream (`remediation.propose`,
   `remediation.approve`, `remediation.reject`, `remediation.approve_blocked`).

## Architecture

The feature follows the editions seam pattern: a **core** model + interface, an
**ee/** implementation, mounted at the `attachEE` seam and gated by the
`remediation` Enterprise feature. Core never imports `ee/`.

| Piece | Location | Edition |
|---|---|---|
| Proposal model, `Service` + `Estimator` interfaces, typed errors | `internal/remediation` | core |
| Propose→approve→reject workflow, advisory-only switch, blast-radius guards, audit | `ee/remediation` | `remediation` (Enterprise) |
| Postgres store (tenant-RLS) | `ee/remediation` (store.go) | `remediation` |
| Dry-run estimator (S43 what-if) | `ee/remediation` (estimator.go) | `remediation` |
| `propose_remediation` MCP tool (proposal-only) | `internal/ai/mcp` | core seam, backed by the ee service |
| `/v1/remediation/*` routes + Admin card | `internal/control`, `web/` | core seam (404 hidden when unlicensed) |

## Dry-run (blast radius)

The estimator runs `topology.Simulate` over a **copy** of the tenant's topology
graph — the same S43 what-if that powers the UI's impact preview — failing the
proposal's target element and counting the affected entities. Blast radius =
impacted services + impacted prefixes + newly-disconnected hosts. It reads the
graph and computes; it mutates nothing and calls nothing external. If the target
is unknown or no topology is loaded, the dry-run returns an **unknown** radius,
which blocks approval (fail closed).

## API

All routes are tenant-scoped and hidden (404) when the feature is unlicensed.

| Method · Route | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/remediation/proposals` | `remediation.propose` | list (newest first) + `approvals_enabled` |
| `POST /v1/remediation/proposals` | `remediation.propose` | files a proposal — always `proposed` |
| `GET /v1/remediation/proposals/{id}` | `remediation.propose` | one proposal |
| `POST /v1/remediation/proposals/{id}/approve` | `remediation.approve` | the ONLY path to `approved`; fails closed |
| `POST /v1/remediation/proposals/{id}/reject` | `remediation.approve` | records a decline |

Fail-closed approval errors map to `409 Conflict` with a machine code:
`approvals_disabled`, `blast_radius_exceeded`, `blast_radius_unknown`,
`not_proposed`.

## MCP tool

`propose_remediation` (permission `remediation.propose`) lets the assistant file
a proposal. It delegates to the same `Propose` path as the API and can only ever
produce a `proposed` proposal — the catalog exposes **no** approve/execute tool.
The proposer is recorded as `ai:propose_remediation`, distinct from the human
`user:<email>` who later decides. On the lightweight `mcp-stdio` transport the
tool is inert (the full workflow rides the HTTP transport wired through
`attachEE`); a core file can never import `ee/`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PROBECTL_REMEDIATION_APPROVALS_ENABLED` | `false` | advisory-only master switch |
| `PROBECTL_REMEDIATION_MAX_BLAST_RADIUS` | `50` | approvable blast-radius ceiling (1–100000) |

Permissions `remediation.propose` + `remediation.approve` are seeded to the
admin role in migration `0035`.

## What this is NOT

Per CLAUDE.md §10 (*out of scope / never do*) and guardrail 8, probectl does
**not** ship un-gated autonomous remediation. There is no auto-apply, no
"remediate now", no inline enforcement, and no background actor that acts on a
proposal. Approve is a human record, not a trigger. If a future sprint ever adds
an execution integration, it must remain human-gated, dry-run-first,
blast-radius-limited, tenant- and RBAC-scoped, and fully audited — and it would
require a fresh human sign-off, because it changes this contract.
