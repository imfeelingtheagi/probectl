# Configuration

This documents netctl's configuration conventions and the local dev-stack
service contract. Concrete config **keys** are added by the sprints that
introduce them (the control plane in S1, the agent in S5, …); every new key is
documented here in the same PR (CLAUDE.md §6, §8).

## Conventions

- **Control plane:** configured via environment variables with the `NETCTL_`
  prefix; the S1 keys are listed below.
- **Agent:** configured via a YAML file or environment variables. Schema lands
  in S5.
- **Secrets** are never hardcoded, logged, or placed in URLs/query strings;
  sensitive values at rest use envelope encryption (S3). See CLAUDE.md §7.

## Control plane (`netctl-control`) — S1

Subcommands: `netctl-control [serve]` (default), `netctl-control migrate` (apply
migrations and exit), `netctl-control version`.

Invalid values fail fast: `netctl-control` reports **all** configuration problems
at once and exits non-zero. The database password is redacted from logs.

From S2, tenant-owned tables are protected by Row-Level Security. The
`NETCTL_DATABASE_URL` role must be able to assume the least-privilege `netctl_app`
role (a superuser always can; otherwise run `GRANT netctl_app TO <login_role>`),
which `internal/tenancy` assumes per transaction so isolation holds regardless of
how the control plane authenticated. See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

### HTTP endpoints (S1)

| Method & path      | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /healthz`     | Liveness — `200` while the process is serving            |
| `GET /readyz`      | Readiness — `200` when the database is reachable, else `503` |
| `GET /version`     | Build and runtime metadata                               |
| `GET /openapi.json`| The OpenAPI 3.1 document                                 |

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id` (honoring an inbound one) and the
security headers `Strict-Transport-Security` (when enabled) and
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Versioned resource routes under `/v1` arrive
in S9+.

### Error envelope

All errors share one JSON shape and a stable domain-error → HTTP mapping:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "…", "request_id": "…" } }
```

| Domain kind   | Code           | HTTP |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| BadRequest    | `bad_request`  | 400  |
| Unauthorized  | `unauthorized` | 401  |
| Forbidden     | `forbidden`    | 403  |
| NotFound      | `not_found`    | 404  |
| Conflict      | `conflict`     | 409  |
| Validation    | `validation`   | 422  |
| Internal      | `internal`     | 500  |
| Unavailable   | `unavailable`  | 503  |

### Transport security (S3)

The API listens over TLS in two interchangeable ways:

- **App-terminated TLS** — set `NETCTL_TLS_CERT_FILE` + `NETCTL_TLS_KEY_FILE`, and
  the control plane serves **HTTPS only** (TLS 1.2+, prefer 1.3; plaintext is
  refused).
- **Ingress-terminated TLS** — leave them unset and serve HTTP behind a
  TLS-terminating ingress (the shipped Helm/compose default). HSTS is set either
  way, so the posture is correct end to end.

All TLS and crypto policy lives in `internal/crypto`; a CI guard
(`scripts/check_crypto_imports.sh`) forbids crypto-primitive imports elsewhere so
a FIPS 140-3 module can be swapped in (F32). At-rest secrets use the envelope
helper (a per-record data key wrapped by a KMS/HSM-pluggable KEK; the dev
`StaticKeyProvider` reads `NETCTL_ENVELOPE_KEY`).

### Agent transport (S4)

The agent gRPC transport (`netctl.agent.v1.AgentService`) runs when
`NETCTL_AGENT_GRPC_ADDR` and the three `NETCTL_AGENT_TLS_*` files are set. It is
**mTLS-only** (`RequireAndVerifyClientCert`): an agent's tenant and id come from
its client certificate's tenant-bound SPIFFE identity
(`spiffe://netctl/tenant/<t>/agent/<a>`), never from the request body, so every
result it emits is tenant-attributable at the source (F50). Generate dev mTLS
material with the `internal/crypto` CA helpers. The `.proto` lives under
`proto/netctl/agent/v1/`; regenerate Go with `make proto` (tools via
`make proto-tools`).

### netctl-agent (S5)

The agent is configured by a YAML file (`-config` or `NETCTL_AGENT_CONFIG`); see
[`deploy/agent/netctl-agent.example.yml`](../deploy/agent/netctl-agent.example.yml).
Its tenant and id are derived from its client certificate's SPIFFE identity, not
configured. `NETCTL_AGENT_GRPC_ADDR`, `NETCTL_AGENT_TLS_{CERT,KEY,CA}_FILE`,
`NETCTL_AGENT_BUFFER_DIR`, and `NETCTL_AGENT_LOG_{LEVEL,FORMAT}` override the file.
Results buffer to disk (`buffer.dir`, bounded by `max_records`) while the control
plane is unreachable and drain on reconnect (at-least-once). Probing runs
independently of connectivity, so an outage never blocks measurement.

### Result pipeline (S6)

A streamed result flows agent → gRPC `StreamResults` → control-plane ingest →
result bus (`netctl.network.results`, Protobuf) → consumer → time-series writer.
The agent sends the canonical OTel-aligned result (`proto/netctl/result/v1`); the
control plane **re-stamps the tenant and agent id from the verified mTLS
certificate** before publishing, so a result is always attributed to the sending
agent's tenant regardless of payload contents (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrails 1 and 5).
The bus key is the `tenant_id`.

`NETCTL_BUS_MODE` selects the bus: `memory` (default; in-process, for the
lightweight <5-agent deployment and single-binary runs) or `kafka` (set
`NETCTL_BUS_BROKERS`). `NETCTL_TSDB_MODE` selects the writer: `memory` (default;
in-process) or `prometheus` remote-write to `NETCTL_TSDB_URL` (Prometheus with
`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver`, or VictoriaMetrics; use an `https://` URL
for TLS in transit). Each probe emits `netctl_probe_success`,
`netctl_probe_duration_seconds`, and one `netctl_probe_<metric>` per custom
metric, labeled `tenant_id`, `agent_id`, `canary_type`, and `server_address`. The
canonical signal→OTel mapping is in [`otel-mapping.md`](otel-mapping.md).

### ICMP test (S7)

The `icmp` canary measures echo **loss, latency, and jitter** to a `target`
(IPv4 or IPv6). Configure it per-canary under `canaries:` (see
[`netctl-agent.example.yml`](../deploy/agent/netctl-agent.example.yml)). The
schedule `interval` and reply `timeout` are canary fields; the rest are `params`:

| Param           | Default | Meaning                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `count`         | `5`     | echo requests per probe (continuous mode defaults to the interval in s) |
| `payload_bytes` | `56`    | ICMP data bytes (minimum 8)                                             |
| `dscp`          | `0`     | DSCP marking 0–63 on outgoing packets (best-effort by platform)         |
| `mode`          | `batch` | `batch` (back-to-back) or `continuous` (1 packet/sec)                   |
| `privileged`    | `false` | `true` prefers raw sockets; default is unprivileged datagram ICMP       |

It emits `netctl_probe_loss_ratio`, `netctl_probe_rtt_{min,avg,max,stddev}_ms`,
`netctl_probe_jitter_ms`, and `netctl_probe_packets_{sent,received}`. A probe with
100% loss reports `success=false` (target unreachable); partial loss is a success
with a non-zero loss ratio. **Continuous mode** records a per-second drop-timing
record as result attributes (`icmp.dropped_seqs`, `icmp.drop_send_offsets_ms`) —
carried as OTel attributes, not TSDB labels, so they don't widen cardinality.

**Privileges.** By default the agent uses **unprivileged** datagram ICMP
(`IPPROTO_ICMP`), which on Linux requires the agent's group to be within
`net.ipv4.ping_group_range` (e.g. `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0
2147483647"`). Alternatively grant raw-socket capability
(`setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/bin/netctl-agent`, or run with `CAP_NET_RAW`) and set
`privileged: "true"`. The canary tries the preferred socket and falls back to the
other; if neither can be opened it returns an internal error (the probe is not
silently reported as loss).

### TCP & UDP tests (S8)

The `tcp` and `udp` canaries are agent-to-server probes. Configure a `target` of
`host:port` (or a `host` with `params.port`). Both accept `count` and `dscp`.

The **`tcp`** canary measures **connect latency + reachability** (a connect-based,
unprivileged equivalent of a TCP-SYN test): it establishes a connection and times
the handshake, emitting `netctl_probe_connect_{min,avg,max,stddev}_ms`,
`netctl_probe_jitter_ms`, and `netctl_probe_loss_ratio` (failed connects = loss;
all-failed = `success=false`).

The **`udp`** canary is an **echo round-trip** probe: it sends token-tagged
datagrams and matches the echoes, emitting `netctl_probe_rtt_*` + loss. It needs a
target that echoes (a UDP echo service, or a netctl agent-to-agent responder); a
non-echoing target reports as 100% loss. `params.payload_bytes` (≥10) sets the
datagram size.

### DNS tests (S12)

The `dns` canary queries DNS and reports **resolution time, the answer, and an
optional DNSSEC verdict**. The `target` is the **query name**. Parameters:

| Param | Values | Default | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `type` | `A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `TXT`, `NS`, … | `A` | record type to query |
| `transport` | `udp` \| `tcp` \| `dot` \| `doh` | `udp` | how the query is sent |
| `server` | `host[:port]` or a DoH URL | per-transport | resolver to query |
| `mode` | `resolver` \| `trace` | `resolver` | single query vs. delegation walk |
| `dnssec` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | validate the zone signature |

`server` defaults by transport: the first nameserver in `/etc/resolv.conf` (or
`1.1.1.1:53`) for `udp`/`tcp`, `1.1.1.1:853` for **DoT**, and
`https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` for **DoH**. DoT verifies the resolver's
TLS certificate (TLS 1.2+); DoH posts an RFC 8484 `application/dns-message` query
over HTTPS.

In **resolver mode** the canary emits `netctl_probe_dns_query_ms` (round-trip) and
`netctl_probe_dns_answers` (answer count), with `dns.rcode` and a compact
`dns.answer` summary as attributes. The probe is `success=false` on a non-`NOERROR`
rcode or an empty answer.

With `dnssec: "true"` the canary requests DNSSEC records (the DO bit) and
**validates the zone's `RRSIG` over the answer against the zone `DNSKEY`** — it
does **not** trust the resolver's AD bit. The verdict lands in the `dns.dnssec`
attribute (`secure`, `insecure` for an unsigned zone, or `bogus`) and
`netctl_probe_dns_dnssec_secure` (1/0); a **bogus** result (tampered, expired, or
wrong-key signature) fails the probe. Validation verifies the signature on the
answer RRset; full chain-to-root anchoring is a later refinement.

In **trace mode** the canary performs an **iterative delegation walk** from the
root hints, following `NS`/glue referrals down to the authoritative server (UDP,
capped iterations, with a recursive fallback when a referral ships no glue). It
emits `netctl_probe_dns_query_ms` (total walk time) and
`netctl_probe_dns_trace_hops`, with the delegation chain in the `dns.trace`
attribute. DNS-exfiltration detection and open-data baselines are out of scope here
(S42 / open-data sprints).

### HTTP server tests (S13)

The `http` canary measures **HTTP(S) availability** with a full **response-time
breakdown** and captures **TLS handshake details** for the TLS-posture plane
(S27). The `target` is the URL. Parameters:

| Param | Values | Default | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `method` | `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, … | `GET` | request method |
| `expect_status` | codes / classes / ranges | `2xx,3xx` | which statuses count as available |
| `follow_redirects` | `true` \| `false` | `true` | follow 3xx redirects |
| `insecure_skip_verify` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | capture TLS but don't fail on an invalid cert |
| `ca_file` | path to a PEM bundle | — | extra trust anchor (private/internal CA) |
| `body` | string | — | request body (e.g. for `POST`) |
| `max_body_bytes` | integer | `10485760` | cap bytes read per probe (10 MiB) |

`expect_status` is a comma list of exact codes (`200`), classes (`2xx`), and
inclusive ranges (`200-204`); a response outside the set is `success=false` (the
status is still reported). The probe emits the timing breakdown as metrics —
`netctl_probe_http_dns_ms` (resolution), `netctl_probe_http_connect_ms` (TCP
connect), `netctl_probe_http_tls_ms` (TLS handshake), `netctl_probe_http_ttfb_ms`
(time to first byte), and `netctl_probe_http_total_ms` — plus
`netctl_probe_http_status`, `netctl_probe_http_content_bytes`, and
`netctl_probe_http_throughput_kbps`. A phase that does not occur (no DNS for an IP
target, no TLS for `http://`) is omitted rather than reported as zero. The resolved
server IP is captured as the `network.peer.address` attribute, which **correlates
the result to path/traceroute data** for the same destination (S10).

**TLS capture (for S27).** On HTTPS the canary records the negotiated
`tls.protocol.version` and `tls.cipher`, the leaf certificate's
`tls.server.{subject,issuer,not_before,not_after,san}`, the chain shape
(`tls.server.chain`), and a `netctl_probe_http_tls_cert_expiry_days` metric
(negative once expired). It verifies the chain itself (hostname + trust, honoring
`ca_file`) **after** capturing the certificate, so the handshake details are
recorded **even when the certificate is invalid or expired** — an invalid cert
fails the probe but its details are still attached. Set `insecure_skip_verify:
"true"` to capture posture without failing the availability check. netctl performs
no TLS *posture analysis* here (issuer trust, weak-cipher/expiry policy, CT) — that
is S27, which consumes these captured fields.

### Agent-to-agent tests (S8)

An agent-to-agent (A2A) test measures **between two registered agents**, brokered
by the control plane. The control plane assigns roles (one agent **responds**,
opening a short-lived listener; the other **initiates**), rendezvouses the
responder's endpoint to the initiator, and hands each agent its task when it
polls (`PollCoordination` / `ReportEndpoint`). The measurement is TWAMP-lite: the
initiator timestamps each probe (T1), the responder stamps receive/send (T2/T3)
and echoes, and the initiator stamps receive (T4), yielding **round-trip**
(`netctl_probe_rtt_*`) plus **forward** and **reverse** one-way delay
(`netctl_probe_forward_avg_ms`, `netctl_probe_reverse_avg_ms`). The responder also
reports forward-direction delivery (`netctl_probe_packets_received`,
`netctl_probe_loss_ratio`), so both agents and both directions are observed.

Enable participation in the agent's `a2a` block: `enabled: true`,
`advertise_host` (the address peers use to reach this agent's responder),
`poll_interval`, and `responder_ttl`. **Caveats (document for production):**

- **NAT/firewall.** The responder advertises `advertise_host`; behind NAT this
  must be a reachable address and the responder's ephemeral port must be
  reachable from the initiator. Auto-detection picks a non-loopback IPv4 — set
  `advertise_host` explicitly when that is wrong.
- **Clocks.** Forward/reverse one-way delays assume the two agents' clocks are
  synchronized (exact within one host; use **NTP** across hosts). Round-trip is
  clock-independent.

Sessions are brokered in-memory and triggered by the test API in a later sprint.

### Path discovery (S10)

The ECMP/MPLS-aware path engine (`internal/path`) runs Paris-style traceroutes
(ICMP and TCP) and merges per-flow traces into a multi-path result; see
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md). A **full per-hop trace needs raw sockets**:
grant `CAP_NET_RAW` (`setcap cap_net_raw+ep`, or run privileged) to capture
intermediate hops + MPLS; unprivileged, only the destination is discovered.
Discovered paths persist via `internal/store/pathstore` — `memory`
(lightweight/tests) or `clickhouse` (writes hop/link rows to a ClickHouse HTTP
endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:8123`, partitioned by tenant). Scheduling path
tests on agents and ingesting results lands with the S11 visualization that
consumes them.

### BGP routing intelligence (S14)

The BGP plane is a Python analyzer (`analyzer/`) plus a Go bridge (`internal/bgp`);
see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). The analyzer ingests **public** collector
data and emits `netctl.bgp.events`:

```sh
python -m netctl_analyzer --config config.json --mrt rib.mrt        # RouteViews/RIS dump
python -m netctl_analyzer --config config.json --replay cap.jsonl   # recorded RIS Live
python -m netctl_analyzer --config config.json --ris-live           # live RIS Live websocket
```

The JSON config is **per tenant** (`tenant_id` is required — every event carries
it, and the bridge rejects any event without one):

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `tenant_id` | the owning tenant (outermost scope) |
| `monitored_prefixes[].prefix` | a prefix to watch (a more-specific announcement is matched too) |
| `monitored_prefixes[].expected_origins` | allowed origin ASNs — an origin outside this set raises `possible_hijack` |
| `monitored_prefixes[].no_transit` | ASNs that must not transit this prefix — mid-path appearance raises `possible_leak` |
| `collector` | collector label recorded on events (e.g. `rrc00`) |
| `rpki_vrp_file` / `rpki_vrp_url` | a `rpki-client`/Routinator VRP JSON export for RFC 6811 validation (absent → `unknown`) |

The analyzer emits `netctl.bgp.events` as **JSON Lines**; the Go bridge tails that
stream, validates the tenant, and republishes each as the canonical
`netctl.bgp.v1.BGPEvent` protobuf onto the bus (topic `netctl.bgp.events`, keyed by
tenant). Event types: `origin_change` (old/new origin + AS path), `possible_hijack`,
`possible_leak`, `rpki_invalid`; each carries an RPKI status (`valid` / `invalid` /
`not_found` / `unknown`), a severity, and a confidence — they are **signals**, not
actions (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrail 9). MRT dumps are **stream-processed** (no full RIB
in memory); a down RPKI/collector source degrades gracefully (guardrail 10).
RouteViews/RIS are open data — their AUP/provenance matters for MSP/commercial
resale, not for private development or single-tenant OSS use.

### Open-data enrichment (S15)

`internal/opendata` annotates IPs with ASN / geo / IXP / allocation context from
public datasets; see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and the source
provenance/AUP matrix in [`opendata-aup.md`](opendata-aup.md). The framework is a
library (wired into flow/test enrichment in later sprints); each source is
pluggable and individually enable-able:

| Source | Kind | Input it needs | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | -------------- | ----- |
| Team Cymru | `asn` | a DNS resolver | IP→ASN/prefix/registry/AS-name via the Cymru IP-to-ASN DNS service |
| MaxMind GeoLite2 | `geo` | a `.mmdb` path (`OpenMMDB`) | country/city/lat-lon; **operator-supplied DB** (not shipped) |
| PeeringDB | `ixp` | the ASN (from Cymru) | IXP/facility presence via the PeeringDB REST API; cached per ASN |
| RIR delegated-stats | `allocation` | a delegated-extended stats file | RIR/country/status/date; parsed once into a sorted index |
| RIPE Atlas (optional) | `measurement` | an API key + credits | active ping/traceroute scheduling hook; **off (fail-closed) by default** |

The `Enricher` runs every **enabled** source over an IP and merges the results,
**caching per IP** and **degrading gracefully**: a disabled / failing / slow /
panicking source is logged, marked `degraded` or `disabled` in `Enricher.Status()`,
and skipped — a partial enrichment is returned and a down dataset never breaks a
core path. Sources run in registration order (register the ASN source before
PeeringDB). Each contribution records `Provenance` (source + license + attribution
+ fields); a source's AUP (license, commercial-use permission, attribution) is on
its `Descriptor` — the matrix that gates MSP/commercial resale (not private or
single-tenant OSS use). All fetches are over TLS with certificate validation and
treated as untrusted (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrails 10, 12). Open data is ingested
**once and shared**; enrichment is scoped per tenant by the consuming record.

### Alerting (S16)

The alerting engine (`internal/alert`) evaluates rules over the TSDB and notifies
channels; see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). Rules are CRUD'd via
**`/v1/alerts`** (tenant-scoped) and the engine runs in the control plane, ticking
every `NETCTL_ALERT_EVAL_INTERVAL` (default `30s`).

A rule targets a metric series and is either a **threshold** or a **baseline**
rule:

| Field | Applies | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `metric` + `match` | both | the TSDB metric (e.g. `netctl_probe_loss_ratio`) and label matchers |
| `type` | both | `threshold` \| `baseline` |
| `comparison` + `threshold` | threshold | `gt`/`lt`/`gte`/`lte`/`eq`/`neq` vs a bound |
| `window` + `sensitivity` | baseline | rolling-history size and deviation (in std-devs); warms up until the window fills |
| `for_n` | both | consecutive breaching evals before firing (debounce) |
| `renotify_seconds` | both | re-notify cadence while firing (`0` = notify once) |
| `severity` | both | `info` \| `warning` \| `critical` |
| `channels` | both | webhook / email destinations |

A `channels` entry is `{"type":"webhook","url":...,"secret":...}` or
`{"type":"email","recipients":[...]}`. The webhook **secret** is the HMAC key; it
is **redacted (`***`) from API responses** and never returned. SMTP for email is
configured at the deployment level (a follow-up exposes it as config).

**Webhook payload (`netctl.alert.v1`).** On fire/resolve the webhook channel POSTs:

```json
{
  "version": "netctl.alert.v1",
  "state": "firing",
  "rule": { "id": "…", "name": "loss-high" },
  "tenant_id": "…",
  "severity": "critical",
  "metric": "netctl_probe_loss_ratio",
  "labels": { "server_address": "1.1.1.1" },
  "value": 0.9,
  "threshold": 0.5,
  "comparison": "gt",
  "reason": "netctl_probe_loss_ratio=0.9 gt 0.5",
  "fired_at": "2026-01-02T15:04:05Z"
}
```

When the channel has a secret, the request carries
`X-Netctl-Signature: sha256=<hex>` — the HMAC-SHA256 of the exact body — so the
receiver can verify the sender. Each channel delivers independently: a failing
channel is logged and skipped, never blocking the others. Alerts are **signals**;
netctl notifies and does not act on the network (on-call/ITSM routing is S33,
detection-as-code is S42).

### Incidents (S17)

The incident correlator (`internal/incident`) groups related signals across planes
into one **Incident** with a unified **timeline**; see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).
It runs in the control plane, fed by the alert engine (network plane) and a
`netctl.bgp.events` consumer (BGP plane), and is exposed at **`/v1/incidents`**
(tenant-scoped):

- `GET /v1/incidents` — the tenant's incidents, most-recently-active first.
- `GET /v1/incidents/{id}` — an incident with its time-ordered signal timeline.
- `PATCH /v1/incidents/{id}` with `{"status":"resolved"}` — resolve an incident.

Signals correlate into one incident when they are **close in time**
(within `NETCTL_INCIDENT_WINDOW`, default `10m`) **and related in target** — the
same target, an IP inside the other's prefix (either direction), or overlapping
prefixes (so a network alert on `192.0.2.10` and a BGP event on `192.0.2.0/24`
land together). An incident's severity is the **max** of its signals; a signal
without a tenant is rejected (fail closed).

The model is **extensible without schema churn**: a `Signal` carries a free-form
`plane`/`kind` and an arbitrary `attributes` map, so later sprints attach the
change (S29), threat (S42), cost, and SLO planes as additional signal types onto
the same `Incident`/timeline. AI root-cause analysis over the timeline is S24.

### SSO & RBAC (S18)

netctl authenticates users with **OIDC SSO** and authorizes them with **RBAC** over
the S2 role model. The security order is the **two-level boundary** (CLAUDE.md §7
guardrails 1, 5): a request resolves to **exactly one tenant first**, then RBAC
decides whether the caller may perform the route's action within that tenant.

**Login flow.** `GET /auth/login` (optionally `?tenant=<uuid>`) starts the OIDC
authorization-code flow: it sets a short-lived, HttpOnly CSRF `state` cookie and
redirects to the tenant's identity provider. The IdP redirects back to
`GET /auth/callback`, which verifies the `state`, exchanges the code, verifies the
ID token, **just-in-time provisions** the user within the tenant (a brand-new user
gets **no roles** — a secure default; an admin grants access), mints a server-side
session, and sets the session cookie. `POST /auth/logout` revokes the session.
`GET /v1/me` returns the caller's tenant, identity, and effective permissions.

**Sessions.** A session is a random, high-entropy opaque token. Only its **hash**
is stored (table `sessions`), so a database read cannot mint a session (guardrail
6). The session cookie is **HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax**, and **Secure** whenever the
API serves HTTPS. `NETCTL_SESSION_TTL` (default `12h`) bounds its lifetime.

**Per-tenant IdP.** Providers are resolved per tenant through a provider factory —
the seam for a tenant bringing its own SSO. S18 ships the env-configured default
(`NETCTL_OIDC_*`); DB-backed per-tenant IdP config is a later sprint. A login
always resolves to a single tenant. Provider/MSP operators authenticate into the
**provider domain** (S-T1), not into tenant data.

**RBAC.** Every `/v1` route declares a required **permission key**; the wrapped
handler returns **401** when unauthenticated and **403** when the principal lacks
the permission — checked *before* the handler runs. Effective permissions are
loaded per request from the user's role bindings (RLS-scoped to the tenant), so a
role grant or revoke takes effect immediately. The permission catalog:

| Permission        | Granted to (seeded roles)   | Guards |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| `test.read`       | viewer, editor, admin       | `GET /v1/tests*`, `GET /v1/tests/{id}/path` |
| `test.write`      | editor, admin               | `POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/tests*`, `POST .../path` |
| `agent.read`      | viewer, editor, admin       | `GET /v1/agents*` |
| `agent.write`     | admin                       | `PATCH/DELETE /v1/agents/{id}` |
| `alert.read`      | viewer, editor, admin       | `GET /v1/alerts*` |
| `alert.write`     | editor, admin               | `POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/alerts*` |
| `incident.read`   | viewer, editor, admin       | `GET /v1/incidents*` |
| `incident.write`  | editor, admin               | `PATCH /v1/incidents/{id}` |

The seeded system roles for the default tenant are **admin** (all permissions),
**editor** (read everything + manage tests/alerts/incidents), and **viewer**
(read-only). `GET /v1/me` requires only authentication (no specific permission).

**Dev mode.** `NETCTL_AUTH_MODE=dev` (the default for local work and the test
suite) bypasses SSO and synthesizes an all-permissions principal for the default
tenant, with the `X-Netctl-Tenant: <uuid>` override for multi-tenant dev. It is
**never** for production — set `NETCTL_AUTH_MODE=session` and configure
`NETCTL_OIDC_*` there.

### Resource API & CLI (S9)

The versioned resource API lives under **`/v1`** (full schema at `/openapi.json`):

- `GET/POST /v1/tests`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /v1/tests/{id}` — synthetic-test CRUD.
- `GET /v1/agents`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/agents/{id}` — agents register over
  mTLS; the API lists, renames, and deregisters them.
- `GET/POST /v1/tests/{id}/path` (S11) — the latest discovered network path for a
  test, and a trigger to discover it now. The path-viz hero UI (Path & Topology)
  consumes this.

Every `/v1` route is **tenant-scoped** through `internal/tenancy` + Postgres RLS,
so a request can never read or write across tenants. **Authentication and RBAC are
real from S18** (see *SSO & RBAC* below): the caller's tenant and effective
permissions come from an authenticated session, and each route requires a
permission. The `no undocumented routes` rule is enforced by a test that matches
the route table against `openapi.json`.

The **`netctl` CLI** is the web-parity client. Configure it with flags or
environment: `NETCTL_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8080`),
`NETCTL_API_TOKEN` (sent as Bearer), `NETCTL_TENANT` (sent as `X-Netctl-Tenant`).

```bash
netctl test list
netctl test create --name edge-dns --type icmp --target 1.1.1.1 --interval 30
netctl test delete <id>
netctl agent list
netctl --json test list      # machine-readable output
```

### eBPF host agent (S20)

The eBPF agent (`netctl-ebpf-agent`) is configured by a YAML file (`-config` or
`NETCTL_EBPF_CONFIG`); see
[`deploy/agent/netctl-ebpf-agent.example.yml`](../deploy/agent/netctl-ebpf-agent.example.yml)
and [`ebpf-agent.md`](ebpf-agent.md). `NETCTL_EBPF_*` env vars override the file.
The agent is **observe-only**; the CO-RE loader is compiled in only with
`-tags ebpf` — otherwise set `fixture_path` for the no-kernel path.

| Variable                     | Default     | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_CONFIG`         | (none)      | path to the YAML config (`-config` flag overrides)             |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_TENANT_ID`      | (required)  | tenant every flow is stamped with (F50)                        |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_HOST`           | OS hostname | observing host name                                            |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_BUS_MODE`       | `memory`    | `memory` \| `kafka`                                            |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_BUS_BROKERS`    | (none)      | comma-separated Kafka brokers (kafka mode)                     |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_FIXTURE_PATH`   | (none)      | replay recorded flows instead of loading eBPF (no-kernel path) |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_L7_FIXTURE_PATH` | (none)     | replay recorded L7 events (no-kernel L7 path, S21)             |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_LIBSSL`         | (auto)      | libssl path for TLS-uprobe L7 capture (`-tags ebpf`)           |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_PROC_ROOT`      | `/proc`     | procfs root for process/cgroup enrichment                      |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_FLUSH_INTERVAL` | `10s`       | how often flows + the service map are emitted                  |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_LOG_LEVEL`      | `info`      | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error`                         |
| `NETCTL_EBPF_LOG_FORMAT`     | `json`      | `json` \| `text`                                               |

Flows + service edges are published to `netctl.ebpf.flows` (`ebpfv1.FlowBatch`,
tenant-keyed). The live loader needs a BTF Linux kernel (≥5.8) and
`CAP_BPF`/`CAP_PERFMON`; see [`ebpf-agent.md`](ebpf-agent.md).

### OTLP receiver (S22)

The control plane optionally ingests external OpenTelemetry metrics over OTLP —
**TLS-only, authenticated, and tenant-scoped** (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrail 12). It is
off by default and runs on its own listeners (separate from the `/v1` REST API).
See [`otlp.md`](otlp.md).

| Variable                    | Default | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NETCTL_OTLP_GRPC_ADDR`     | (none)  | OTLP/gRPC listen address (e.g. `:4317`)                      |
| `NETCTL_OTLP_HTTP_ADDR`     | (none)  | OTLP/HTTP listen address (e.g. `:4318`; `POST /v1/metrics`)  |
| `NETCTL_OTLP_TLS_CERT_FILE` | (none)  | PEM server certificate (required to enable)                  |
| `NETCTL_OTLP_TLS_KEY_FILE`  | (none)  | PEM server private key (required to enable)                  |
| `NETCTL_OTLP_TOKENS`        | (none)  | bearer-token→tenant map: `token1=tenant1,token2=tenant2`     |

Setting an address without the TLS files **and** at least one token fails config
validation — the receiver is never anonymous plaintext. Ingested metrics are
tenant-tagged and published to the `netctl.otlp.metrics` bus topic.

### AI assistant (S24)

The AI assistant (RCA / NL query) is on by default using the **built-in,
in-process synthesizer** — fully air-gapped, no network, no phone-home. Point it
at a model only if you want LLM-written prose; a remote endpoint must be `https`
(a non-loopback `http` endpoint is refused — guardrail 12), while loopback may be
`http` for a co-located local model. See [`ai-rca.md`](ai-rca.md).

| Variable                   | Default   | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NETCTL_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER` | `builtin` | `builtin` (air-gapped) \| `ollama` \| `openai` \| `anthropic`      |
| `NETCTL_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT` | (none)    | base URL of the model (required for a non-`builtin` provider)      |
| `NETCTL_AI_MODEL_NAME`     | (none)    | model name (e.g. `llama3.1`, `gpt-4o-mini`)                        |
| `NETCTL_AI_MODEL_TOKEN`    | (none)    | API key / bearer token (optional for a local Ollama)              |
| `NETCTL_AI_MODEL_TIMEOUT`  | `60s`     | per-request timeout for the model endpoint                         |
| `NETCTL_AI_MAX_EVIDENCE`   | `50`      | cost guard: max signals an answer may gather                       |

A non-`builtin` provider without an endpoint fails config validation. Whatever
the backend, every answer is tenant-and-RBAC-scoped by the S23 query layer and
every claim is citation-checked before it reaches the user — a model can never
see out-of-scope data or inject an ungrounded claim.

### MCP server (S25)

The MCP server exposes read-only, tenant- + RBAC-scoped tools to AI clients. The
**HTTP** transport is off by default and is **TLS-only + bearer-authenticated**
(guardrail 12); the **stdio** transport is local (`netctl-control mcp-stdio`,
token from `NETCTL_MCP_TOKEN`). See [`mcp.md`](mcp.md).

| Variable                   | Default | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETCTL_MCP_HTTP_ADDR`     | (none)  | MCP HTTP listen address (e.g. `:8090`) — enables the transport |
| `NETCTL_MCP_TLS_CERT_FILE` | (none)  | PEM server certificate (required to enable HTTP)              |
| `NETCTL_MCP_TLS_KEY_FILE`  | (none)  | PEM server private key (required to enable HTTP)              |
| `NETCTL_MCP_RATE_PER_MIN`  | `120`   | per-tenant tool-call rate limit (0 disables)                  |

Setting `NETCTL_MCP_HTTP_ADDR` without the TLS files fails config validation — the
MCP endpoint is never anonymous plaintext.

### TLS / certificate observability (S27)

The control plane analyzes TLS/cert posture from **already-captured** TLS (S13/S21)
— it never re-handshakes — and correlates findings into threat-plane incidents.
See [`tls-observability.md`](tls-observability.md).

| Variable                    | Default        | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETCTL_CERTCTL_URL`        | (none)         | certctl base URL; enables a one-click renewal deep-link on findings |
| `NETCTL_TLS_EXPIRY_WARNING` | `504h` (21d)   | expiring-soon window                                              |
| `NETCTL_CT_ENABLED`         | `false`        | opt in to Certificate Transparency correlation (external fetch)   |
| `NETCTL_CT_ENDPOINT`        | `https://crt.sh` | CT log API endpoint                                             |

CT correlation is **off by default** (an external fetch — sovereignty / AUP /
rate limits) and degrades gracefully when the CT source is down.

### Threat-intel enrichment (S28)

The control plane can match peer IPs / hostnames / certs / JA3 against public
threat-intel feeds, surfacing **confidence-scored, source-attributed** threat-plane
signals (a **signal, not an IPS** — never blocks). See
[`threat-intel.md`](threat-intel.md) for the feed/AUP matrix and caveats.

| Variable                     | Default | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETCTL_THREATINTEL_ENABLED` | `false` | master switch (outbound feed fetches); off ⇒ no IOC code runs     |
| `NETCTL_THREATINTEL_REFRESH` | `6h`    | feed refresh cadence                                              |
| `NETCTL_THREATINTEL_FEEDS`   | (all)   | comma-separated feed names (`spamhaus_drop`, `feodo_tracker`, `sslbl`, `sslbl_ja3`, `urlhaus`, `tor_exit`, `firehol_level1`); empty ⇒ all |

**Off by default** (an outbound fetch — sovereignty / no-phone-home). The
refresher keeps each source's **last-good** indicators, so a feed outage degrades
gracefully and never breaks a core path.

### Enterprise identity: SCIM + ABAC (S31)

SCIM 2.0 provisioning and ABAC have **no environment keys** — the SCIM bearer token
an IdP presents is minted with the control-plane CLI, and ABAC policies are managed
over the API. See [`scim-abac.md`](scim-abac.md).

```
# mint a per-tenant SCIM token for an IdP (shown once)
netctl-control scim-token --tenant <tenant-uuid> --name okta
```

The `/scim/v2/*` surface is gated by a valid SCIM token (no token ⇒ `401`), and the
directory-admin API (`/v1/abac/policies`) requires `directory.read`/`directory.write`.

### Change intelligence (S29)

Ingest per-provider-signed change webhooks (deploys/config/route/IaC/commits) into
a change timeline + change-to-incident correlation, feeding the AI RCA. See
[`change-intel.md`](change-intel.md) for the webhook contract + provider/signature
table.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `NETCTL_CHANGE_WEBHOOKS` | (none) | comma-separated `id:tenant:provider:secret` webhook credentials (`provider` ∈ `generic`/`github`/`gitlab`). The secret is the last field, so it may contain `:` but not `,` — use URL-safe (hex/base64) secrets. |
| `NETCTL_CHANGE_CORRELATION_WINDOW` | `24h` | how far before an incident a change is treated as a candidate cause |

Each inbound delivery is **TLS + signature-verified (HMAC/token, constant-time) +
tenant-bound to the credential**; an unsigned or forged event is rejected before
storage, and one tenant cannot inject another's changes. Webhook secrets are
runtime config — inject them from a secret manager, never commit them.

### SIEM export (S32)

Forward the **audit stream** and **threat-plane signals** to a SOC's SIEM over
hardened TLS. netctl is the **forwarder, not a SIEM** — events are rendered into a
standard format and pushed; nothing is auto-blocked. See [`siem.md`](siem.md) for
formats, delivery guarantees, and per-SIEM setup.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_ENABLED` | `false` | master switch (an outbound connection to your SIEM); off ⇒ no SIEM code runs |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_PRESET` | `generic` | SIEM adapter: `generic`, `splunk`, `sentinel`, `elastic`, `chronicle` (sets the auth scheme + default format) |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_FORMAT` | (preset) | wire format: `syslog` (RFC 5424), `cef`, `ecs`, `otlp`; empty ⇒ the preset's native default (Elastic⇒ecs, Chronicle⇒otlp, else cef) |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_ENDPOINT` | (none) | HTTPS ingest URL (e.g. the Splunk HEC / Sentinel / Chronicle / Elasticsearch endpoint). Required when enabled |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_TOKEN` | (none) | ingest credential (Splunk ⇒ `Splunk <tok>`, Elastic ⇒ `ApiKey <tok>`, others ⇒ `Bearer <tok>`). Inject from a secret manager |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_POLL_INTERVAL` | `30s` | audit-stream drain cadence |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_BUFFER` | `1024` | threat-signal buffer; full ⇒ producers block (backpressure, never drop) |
| `NETCTL_SIEM_REDACT_KEYS` | (none) | extra audit `data` keys to scrub (on top of the built-in secret/PII denylist) |

**Off by default** (an outbound connection — sovereignty / no-phone-home). Audit
forwarding resumes from a **durable per-tenant cursor**, and delivery **retries
without dropping** under a SIEM outage. Exported audit events are **PII/secret
redacted** (built-in denylist + `NETCTL_SIEM_REDACT_KEYS`).

### On-call + ITSM integration (S33)

Mirror incidents into operational tooling: page on-call (PagerDuty/Opsgenie), post
to chat (Slack/Teams), and open + **bidirectionally sync** tickets (ServiceNow/Jira).
netctl is the forwarder, not the system of record — it never auto-blocks anything.
See [`oncall-itsm.md`](oncall-itsm.md) for the connector matrix, mapping, and the
inbound webhook contract.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `NETCTL_NOTIFY_CONNECTORS` | (none) | outbound connectors, comma-separated, each `tenant\|provider\|endpoint\|secret` (pipe-delimited because the endpoint is a URL). `provider` ∈ `pagerduty`/`opsgenie`/`slack`/`teams`/`servicenow`/`jira`. `secret` is the provider credential (PagerDuty routing key, Opsgenie API key, ServiceNow `user:password`, Jira `email:token`; unused for chat). |
| `NETCTL_NOTIFY_INBOUND` | (none) | inbound status-sync credentials, comma-separated, each `id:tenant:provider:secret` (the `id` is the URL selector for `POST /ingest/itsm/{provider}/{id}`; `secret` verifies the delivery). |

**Off by default** (each connector is an outbound connection to the operator's
tooling). Paging + ticket creation are **idempotent** (an incident opens at most
once per connector — a retry/restart never double-pages), status sync is
**bidirectional** with **loop protection** (an inbound resolve from one system is
never echoed back to it), and routing is **per-tenant** (a connector only fires for
its own tenant). Endpoint specifics: a Slack/Teams endpoint is the incoming-webhook
URL; a Jira endpoint carries the project (and optional resolve transition) as query
params, e.g. `…/rest/api/2/issue?project=OPS&resolve_transition=31`; a ServiceNow
endpoint is the `…/api/now/table/incident` URL. Inbound deliveries must include
`X-Netctl-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` or `X-Netctl-Token: <secret>` over TLS; an
unsigned or forged delivery is rejected (`401`). Secrets are runtime config —
inject them from a secret manager, never commit them.

## Local dev stack (`deploy/compose/dev.yml`)

Started with `make compose-up`. **Local, non-production** defaults — plaintext
listeners and dev credentials for convenience. Production deploys are
TLS/HTTPS-by-default (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrail 12).

| Service      | Compose name | Host port(s)        | Purpose                                   | Dev credentials                 |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL   | `postgres`   | `5432`              | Durable state, tenants, RBAC, audit, SLOs | user/pass/db = `netctl`         |
| Kafka        | `kafka`      | `9092`              | Result/event bus (KRaft, no ZooKeeper)    | none (PLAINTEXT)                |
| ClickHouse   | `clickhouse` | `8123` (HTTP), `9000` (native) | High-cardinality events/flows  | user/pass/db = `netctl`         |
| Prometheus   | `prometheus` | `9090`              | Metrics TSDB (remote-write enabled)       | none                            |

Kafka listeners: host clients use `localhost:9092`; in-network containers use
`kafka:19092`; the KRaft controller uses `9093` (internal). Prometheus runs with
`--web.enable-remote-write-receiver` so the result pipeline (S6) can remote-write
into it.

These names and ports are a **contract** introduced in S0 — later sprints and
the integration harness depend on them.

## Tear-down

`make compose-down` removes the containers **and volumes** (`pgdata`, `chdata`,
`promdata`).
