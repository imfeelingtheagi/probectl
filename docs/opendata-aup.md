# Open-data sources — provenance and acceptable-use matrix

## What this is

When probectl sees an IP address, that address alone is not very useful. Which
network owns it? Which country is it in? Is it at an internet exchange? The
**open-data enrichment layer** answers those questions by looking the IP up in
public datasets and attaching the context to the record — *enrichment* means
exactly that: adding context to data you already have, not collecting new data.

It lives in `internal/opendata`. The framework annotates an IP with ASN / geo /
IXP / allocation context (an **ASN** is an autonomous-system number — the ID of
the network operator that announces the address; an **IXP** is an internet
exchange point, where networks physically interconnect; *allocation* is which
regional registry handed the address space out, and when). And — this is the
part this document is about — every
source carries machine-readable **provenance and acceptable-use (AUP)
metadata** describing where the data came from and what you are allowed to do
with it: **provenance** is the data's origin story; the **AUP** (acceptable-use
policy) is its publisher's terms. Think of it as a nutrition label printed on
every dataset — ingredients and permitted use, readable by code, carried with
the data instead of buried in a wiki. That metadata is the `OpenDataSource`
model — a source's
`Descriptor().AUP` — and the live health of each source is surfaced at runtime
via `Enricher.Status()`.

## Why provenance matters

Two reasons, and they pull in different directions:

1. **Tenancy.** Open data is the same for everybody, so probectl ingests it
   **once and shares it across tenants** (one reference library, not a copy
   per reader); the enrichment is then attached
   per-tenant to each flow or test result. The `opendata` package is
   deliberately tenant-agnostic — it returns plain data and the caller stores
   it on a tenant-scoped record, so the tenant boundary is enforced where the
   data lands, not in the shared lookup (see
   [`security/tenant-isolation.md`](security/tenant-isolation.md)).
2. **Licensing for resale.** The AUP terms below are **not a constraint on
   private development or single-tenant open-source use.** They become a gating
   item only for **commercial / MSP resale** — i.e. reselling probectl as a
   service to many customers (see [`editions.md`](editions.md)). If you plan to
   run provider mode commercially, resolve the reseller redistribution terms
   first.

## How sources behave (the three guardrails)

Every source obeys the same safety rules, enforced in code:

- **Fetched over TLS, treated as untrusted.** Outbound lookups use a hardened
  HTTPS client with **certificate validation that is never disabled**, and the
  fetched content is parsed as untrusted input — bounds-checked, malformed rows
  skipped (two of probectl's
  [non-negotiables](../CONTRIBUTING.md#non-negotiables)). A public dataset is
  someone else's bytes; the parser assumes they could be hostile.
- **Graceful degradation.** A source that is disabled, rate-limited, or failing
  is **logged and skipped** — it never breaks a core path. The `Enricher` runs
  each source under a timeout and even recovers from a panicking plugin
  (`runSource` in `enricher.go`), so one flaky dataset cannot take enrichment
  down. A failed source is marked `degraded`; the rest still contribute.
  Enrichment is garnish, never load-bearing: losing it makes records plainer,
  not absent.
- **Cached aggressively.** Enrichment is cached per IP, and each network-bound
  source caches its own dataset (PeeringDB caches per ASN; the RIR stats file is
  parsed once into a sorted in-memory index). So a rate-limited upstream is
  queried at most once per key — being a polite client of a free public
  service is part of the contract.

## Matrix

| Source | `name` | Kind | Provides | License / terms | Commercial use | Attribution required |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | -------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Team Cymru** IP-to-ASN | `team-cymru` | `asn` | ASN, prefix, registry, AS name | Team Cymru community service (free) | allowed-with-attribution | "IP-to-ASN mapping by Team Cymru" |
| **MaxMind GeoLite2** | `maxmind-geolite2` | `geo` | country, city, lat/lon | GeoLite2 EULA (CC BY-SA 4.0 attribution) | allowed-with-attribution | "This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from https://www.maxmind.com" |
| **PeeringDB** | `peeringdb` | `ixp` | IXP / facility presence | PeeringDB data (CC BY 4.0) | allowed-with-attribution | "Data from PeeringDB" |
| **RIR delegated-stats** | `rir-stats` | `allocation` | RIR, country, allocation status/date | RIR delegated statistics (open data) | allowed | — |
| **RIPE Atlas** (optional hook) | — | `measurement` | active ping/traceroute scheduling | RIPE Atlas terms (credit-based) | restricted (credits/terms) | per RIPE Atlas terms |

(The `name`, license, attribution, and commercial-use cells above are taken
verbatim from each source's `Descriptor().AUP` in `internal/opendata` —
`cymru.go`, `maxmind.go`, `peeringdb.go`, `rir.go`. The `name` is what
`Enricher.Status()` reports per source at runtime. The RIPE Atlas row is the
exception: it is a *scheduler hook*, not an enrichment source, so it has no
descriptor — its terms come from RIPE's credit-based AUP, noted in `atlas.go`.)

Notes:

- **MaxMind GeoLite2** is **not shipped** with probectl. The operator supplies
  the `.mmdb` database file (MaxMind's binary geo-database format) under
  MaxMind's license and points the geo source at
  it via `OpenMMDB(path)` (`maxmind.go`). probectl reading a database you
  provide keeps probectl clear of redistributing MaxMind's data — you hold the
  license; probectl just reads your copy.
- **RIPE Atlas** is an **optional active-measurement hook**, not part of the
  passive enrichment path. (RIPE Atlas is a community-run fleet of measurement
  probes; you spend earned credits to schedule tests on it.) It schedules
  measurements on the shared RIPE Atlas
  platform *only* when an API key and credits are configured, and is **disabled
  (fail closed) by default**: with no key, the default `NoopScheduler` returns
  `ErrAtlasDisabled` (`atlas.go`). Because it costs RIPE Atlas credits and is
  governed by RIPE's terms, its commercial use is marked `restricted`.
- **Why "allowed-with-attribution" for three of them?** Team Cymru, MaxMind, and
  PeeringDB permit commercial use but require you to credit the source. The
  required attribution string is carried in each descriptor so a reseller can
  surface it correctly — the label travels with the data, so the credit can't
  be forgotten downstream.

## Related source sets

Threat-intel feeds are a **separate** source set (with their own, often
non-commercial, terms) layered on top of this same framework — see
[`threat-intel.md`](threat-intel.md) for that matrix. Cloud-pricing data for cost analytics
reuses the same provenance/AUP model as well. The pattern is deliberate: every
external dataset, whether for enrichment, threat-intel, or pricing, declares its
provenance the same way.
