# probectl performance baseline

## What this is

This is probectl's **checked-in performance baseline** — a cheap, repeatable
early-warning system that runs in CI, not a full scale validation. Think of it
as a smoke detector, not a fire drill: it exists to catch a regression *now*,
the moment it lands, rather than discovering it later at the full scale gate.

The harness lives in [`internal/perf`](../internal/perf). It is the reusable
engine that the full load gate and the per-tenant fairness work both build on.

The guiding idea is a **smoke, not a soak**: the thresholds below have generous
headroom on purpose. The guard is meant to trip on an *order-of-magnitude*
regression — a pooled-tenancy cardinality blow-up, or a Postgres row-level-
security cost problem — and to stay quiet through ordinary CI timing jitter. If
it goes red, something is genuinely, badly slower.

## What the harness drives

Two drivers exercise the core path **agents → bus → stores → query**:

- **Ingest baseline** (`DriveIngest`, no services) — publishes synthetic probe
  results through the lightweight path (bus → pipeline consumer → in-memory
  TSDB) at a defined scale, and measures end-to-end throughput and publish
  latency. It also asserts *correctness*: every result is ingested, and each
  tenant's series land under its own `tenant_id` (no cross-tenant label mixing).
- **Pooled multi-tenant smoke** (`DrivePooled`, against Postgres) — K tenants
  share the pooled stores; every tenant-scoped query runs concurrently
  (mixed-tenant load) and must return **exactly** its own rows. This is the
  isolation-under-load assertion (a cross-tenant leak would inflate a count; a
  scoping bug would deflate it), and it is the first place a row-level-security
  cost problem shows up.

## Scenarios (CI smoke sizes)

| Scenario | Shape | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest baseline | 4 tenants × 5 agents × 5 tests × 20 results | 2,000 results → 6,000 series |
| Pooled multi-tenant | 20 tenants × 100 rows, 10 query-reps, 16 concurrent | 2,000 rows, 200 tenant-scoped queries |

(Each result produces three series — probe success, probe duration, and one
custom metric — which is why 2,000 results become 6,000 series.) These sizes are
intentionally small (sub-second to a few seconds) so the job stays a CI smoke.
The full L/XL multi-region sizes and the formal noisy-neighbor gate live in the
full-stack load gate — see [`scale-gate.md`](scale-gate.md).

## Regression-guard thresholds

The guard is `perf.M6Baseline()` in code, asserted by the smoke tests. Update
the code and this table together when the numbers move materially.

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest throughput | **≥ 3,000 results/sec** (floor) | the lightweight path; catches a ~10–50× regression |
| Pooled query p95 | **≤ 250 ms** (ceiling) | a tenant-scoped list under mixed load; catches a row-level-security cost blow-up |
| Pooled isolation | **0 mismatches** (hard) | any wrong row count is a correctness failure, never tolerated |

## Illustrative numbers

The figures below are **illustrative, not guarantees** — they come from one
development run on Apple-class arm64, in-process, and they exist only to show the
*shape* of the headroom behind the thresholds. They are not asserted by any test
(only the floors and ceilings above are), and they will differ on your hardware.
CI runners are slower, which is exactly why the thresholds carry so much room.
Refresh this section from a green `perf-smoke` CI run if the baseline shifts.

| Metric | Observed (dev run) | Threshold | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest throughput | ~188,000 results/sec (no race); ~50,000 with `-race` | ≥ 3,000 | dev arm64, memory bus + memory TSDB |
| Ingest publish p95 | ~11 µs | — | dev arm64 |
| Pooled query p50 / p95 / p99 | ~2.4 ms / ~11 ms / ~16 ms | p95 ≤ 250 ms | dev arm64, Postgres, 20 tenants × 100 rows, 16 concurrent |
| Pooled query throughput | ~4,600 queries/sec | — | dev arm64, Postgres |
| Pooled isolation | 0 mismatches (200/200 queries correct) | 0 | dev arm64, Postgres |

These are the lightweight single-consumer path. The Kafka / multi-consumer
profile and real-TSDB remote-write numbers belong to the full-stack load gate,
not here.

## Running it

```bash
make perf-smoke          # ingest baseline (no services) + pooled (uses PROBECTL_DATABASE_URL)
```

The ingest baseline needs no services. The pooled smoke uses
`PROBECTL_DATABASE_URL` and **skips** when no database is reachable, so the
target is safe to run locally without the dev stack. In CI the `perf-smoke` job
runs both against a TLS Postgres started for the run (`verify-full`, like
production). The pooled run also exercises the cross-tenant isolation property
under concurrency, complementing the dedicated cross-tenant-isolation gate.

## Scope / placement notes

- The harness is a **main-module library** (`internal/perf`), not the black-box
  `test/` module — matching how every other integration test in this repo is
  structured (in-module, `integration`-tagged, reaching Postgres via
  `PROBECTL_DATABASE_URL`). The `test/` module stays reserved for the full-stack
  soak.
- **Resource-use capture** (control-plane + store CPU/memory under sustained
  load) is deferred to that full-stack soak, where it is meaningful against real
  services. This baseline focuses on the load-bearing early-warning signals —
  throughput, query latency, and isolation correctness.
