# Releasing probectl

## What a release is

A probectl release is **one git tag** that triggers an automated pipeline to
build, sign, and publish the shipping artifacts: multi-arch container images,
cross-compiled binaries with checksums, software bills of materials (SBOMs), and a
GitHub Release. You do not build or upload anything by hand — you push a tag, and
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) does the rest.

## Versioning scheme

probectl uses **Semantic Versioning** with a `v` prefix: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** — incompatible API / config / migration changes.
- **MINOR** — backward-compatible features.
- **PATCH** — backward-compatible fixes.

While the project is pre-1.0, the major stays `0` and the **MINOR** carries the
feature weight (so a breaking change before 1.0 bumps the MINOR). Pre-releases use
a suffix, e.g. `v0.2.0-rc.1`.

The version is stamped into every binary at build time
(`internal/version`, via `-ldflags`) and surfaced at the `/version` HTTP endpoint
and via `probectl-control version`. So a running binary can always tell you
exactly which tag it was cut from.

## What a release publishes

Pushing a `v*` tag runs `release.yml`, which publishes:

- **Multi-arch container images** (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) for five
  components — `probectl-control`, `probectl-agent`, `probectl-ebpf-agent`,
  `probectl-endpoint`, and `probectl` (the CLI) — to
  `ghcr.io/imfeelingtheagi/<component>`, tagged with the exact version and
  `latest`. Each image carries **SLSA provenance and an SBOM** attestation
  (Buildx `provenance: true` + `sbom: true`). The `probectl-ebpf-agent` image is
  built from `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.ebpf` so it ships the *live* eBPF loader,
  not the fixture replayer.
- **Cross-compiled binaries** for `linux/{amd64,arm64}` plus a `checksums.txt`
  (SHA-256), attached to the GitHub Release.
- A **source SBOM** in SPDX JSON (`probectl_<tag>_sbom.spdx.json`), generated over
  the source tree and lockfiles and shipped as a signed release asset.
- **Keyless cosign signatures** (`.sig` + `.pem`) over every binary, the checksum
  manifest, and the SBOM. The signing identity is this repository's release
  workflow (Sigstore/Fulcio, GitHub OIDC); the same job re-verifies its own
  signatures before finishing, so a release that cannot be verified fails the
  build. Verifiers pin the workflow identity — see
  [`ops/verify-artifacts.md`](ops/verify-artifacts.md).
- An auto-generated **release notes** entry on the GitHub Release.

Image tags follow `ghcr.io/imfeelingtheagi/probectl-control:<version>` (and
`:latest`). **Pin the exact version in production deploys** — compose
`PROBECTL_IMAGE`, Helm `image.tag` — and digest-pin for full immutability (see
[`dependency-policy.md`](dependency-policy.md)).

## Cutting a release

The release pipeline will not build anything unless the **full CI workflow already
concluded green on the exact commit you are tagging** (the `require-green-ci`
gate). Tag pushes do not trigger CI, so this gate looks up the CI run for the
tagged commit and refuses to publish on an untested or red commit — it holds even
for a tag cut off a side branch or by an admin who bypassed branch protection
(branch protection guards the *merge*; this gate independently guards the
*release* — see [`ops/branch-protection.md`](ops/branch-protection.md)).
Practically, that means: get the commit green on `main` first, *then* tag it.

1. Confirm CI is green on the commit you intend to tag — that single CI run
   includes every gate (`cross-tenant-isolation`, `openapi-gate`, `migration-gate`,
   `helm-gate`, `perf-smoke`, and the rest; see
   [`development.md`](development.md) for the full job list).
2. Tag and push:

   ```sh
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "probectl v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

3. The `release` workflow builds and publishes the images, binaries, SBOMs, and
   GitHub Release. Confirm the images and their attestations appear under the
   repository's Packages, and that the release assets include the `.sig`/`.pem`
   signatures.

## Provenance & supply chain

Every released artifact is **verifiable end to end**: images ship build provenance
and an SBOM attestation; binaries, checksums, and the source SBOM are
cosign-signed (keyless / OIDC) and self-verified inside the release job.
Dependency and image vulnerability scanning run in CI on every PR
(`dependency-scan`, `image-scan`) and weekly on a schedule
([`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`](../.github/workflows/security-scan.yml)),
so a vulnerable pin surfaces even when no release is in flight. For how to verify
a downloaded artifact, see [`ops/verify-artifacts.md`](ops/verify-artifacts.md).
