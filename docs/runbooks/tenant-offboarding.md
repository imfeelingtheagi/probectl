# Runbook: tenant offboarding (export → erase → attest)

## What this is

The clean way to remove a tenant: hand them their data, irreversibly delete it
from every store, and produce a signed attestation that it's gone. **Export and
verifiable deletion are core** — a compliance right available in every edition,
not a paid add-on. The provider-console trigger is just the MSP convenience layer
over the same engine.

## 0. Before you start

- Confirm the request's authority (a tenant admin or the contract owner).
- Know your **backup TTL.** Deletion of the *live* stores is attested
  immediately, but snapshots expire on *your* schedule. Set
  `PROBECTL_BACKUP_RETENTION_NOTE` (e.g. "nightly snapshots, 14-day TTL,
  region X") so every attestation states it verbatim. An attestation that says
  nothing about backups is incomplete in spirit — be explicit.

## 1. Export (portability)

Tenant self-service: **Admin → Data lifecycle → Export my data**, or
`GET /v1/lifecycle/export` (permission `lifecycle.export`). The bundle is a
`tar.gz` containing:

- `manifest.json` — row counts, object inventory, and format notes
  (`format_version: 1`);
- `postgres/<table>.jsonl` — every tenant-owned row, one JSON object per line;
- `flows.jsonl` — every flow record, streamed from the flow store.

Time-series metrics are **not** in the bundle: export them via the
Prometheus-compatible API (federation / PromQL) — the manifest says so. Hand the
bundle to the customer **before** you erase anything.

## 2. Suspend, then offboard (provider console)

Suspend stops the tenant's users from logging in. Offboard frees the licensed
band slot and, for a siloed or hybrid tenant, tears down that tenant's
**containers** (its dedicated schema / ClickHouse database). For a pooled tenant,
the rows still physically exist at this point — that's what step 3 erases.

## 3. Erase (irreversible, verifiable)

Provider console (admin): **tenant row → Erase**, or
`POST /provider/v1/tenants/{id}/erase` with body `{"confirm":"<tenant-slug>"}`.
Tenant-side, the equivalent is `POST /v1/lifecycle/erase` (permission
`lifecycle.erase`). The engine walks every store, deletes the tenant's data, and
verifies each store reads zero afterward:

| Store | Mechanism | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres (pooled or silo-routed) | per-table `DELETE` **under the tenant's own scope** (RLS + silo routing — it cannot touch another tenant), multi-pass to satisfy intra-tenant foreign-key ordering | per-table `count(*) == 0` in-scope |
| Provider rows about the tenant (usage, quotas, branding, break-glass, retention) | provider-role-scoped deletes | per-table count == 0 |
| ClickHouse flows | pooled: synchronous lightweight delete (`SETTINGS mutations_sync=2`); siloed: `DROP DATABASE` | post-delete count == 0 |
| Object store | `DeletePrefix` on `tenant/<id>/` and `silo/<id>/` | post-delete list is empty |
| Tenant keys (BYOK editions) | **crypto-shred** — every key version's wrapped key is nulled and the chain marked `destroyed`, so any ciphertext (including in still-live backups) is permanently unreadable, and destroyed chains refuse re-keying | versions-destroyed count on the attestation; unlicensed deployments record "no per-tenant keyring installed" |
| Time-series (TSDB) | memory mode: in-place series delete. Prometheus mode: the engine calls the admin `delete_series` API itself and verifies. **If that admin API is disabled, this becomes a MANUAL STEP** — run `delete_series` for `{tenant_id="<id>"}` yourself (or let retention expire it); the attestation marks this store incomplete until you do | per mode |

> The engine also erases the other tenant-scoped planes the same way (path,
> topology, and externally-ingested OTLP traces/logs) — they appear in the
> attestation's store list too. The table above is the representative subset most
> often asked about.

The tenant registry row is then **tombstoned** (`status=deleted`): the row
remains as a referent for the attestation, but it holds no telemetry.

## 4. The attestation

The engine returns — and the tamper-evident **provider audit chain** records,
along with the report's SHA-256 — a deletion report: per-store deleted counts,
verified-zero flags, your backup-TTL statement, and a `complete` flag. **If
`complete` is false, the notes name exactly what remains** (e.g. the Prometheus
manual step) — finish it and re-run erase (it is idempotent). Hand the
attestation JSON to the customer; the SHA-256 on the provider chain is their
proof it was not edited after the fact.

## 5. After

- **Backups:** the attested deletion covers the live stores. Your snapshots
  expire on the stated TTL — do not restore an erased tenant's backup except
  under legal hold.
- **Custom-domain TLS:** if the tenant had a custom domain, remove its ingress
  certificate and DNS.
- **Agents:** the agents' mTLS identities die with the registry rows;
  decommission the tenant's agent hosts.
