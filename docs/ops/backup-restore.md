# Backup & restore runbook

## What this is

probectl keeps its durable state in two databases. This runbook is how you copy
that state somewhere safe (backup), how you put it back (restore), how long
each takes, and the automated drill that proves the restore path actually
works. Read it before you need it — a restore is the kind of thing you do under
stress.

## What is stateful (and what is deliberately not backed up)

| Store | Holds | Backup? |
|---|---|---|
| **Postgres** | tenants, config/state, RBAC, audit chains, SLOs, incidents | **Yes** — logical `pg_dump` (custom format), nightly |
| **ClickHouse** | flow/path/threat/change/cost events + the `probectl_ch_migrations` ledger | **Yes** — native `BACKUP DATABASE … TO File()`, nightly |
| Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics | metric series | Optional — operational telemetry, rebuildable by re-ingesting the retention window. Use the snapshot API if your org requires it. |
| Object store | support bundles, WORM audit exports | Replicate the bucket. The WORM export is itself the tamper-evident off-database copy of the provider audit chain. |
| Kafka | results/events in transit | No — it's transit, not a system of record. Consumers drain it into the stores above. |

**Backups contain tenant data**, so they are **encrypted at rest by default.**
The chart's Postgres backup CronJob pipes the dump through
`probectl-control backup-seal`, so plaintext never touches the backups volume —
the artifact is a `.dump.pbk` envelope-encrypted container, sealed with the
deployment's at-rest key (the **same** `PROBECTL_ENVELOPE_KEY` as live storage).
ClickHouse's `BACKUP TO File` runs *inside* the ClickHouse server, so it can't
be piped through that filter; it is encrypted by the **backups volume** instead
(the encrypted-volume operator duty in [hardening.md](../hardening.md) §0c, which
`probectl-control preflight --strict` checks). Either way, restrict access to
the backups and keep them inside the operator's network — telemetry never
leaves it (one of the project's
[non-negotiables](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#non-negotiables)).

## Taking backups

One-shot (any time — e.g. right before an upgrade):

```sh
./scripts/backup_postgres.sh   /srv/probectl-backups   # → postgres-<db>-<ts>.dump + .sha256
./scripts/backup_clickhouse.sh /srv/probectl-backups   # → clickhouse-<db>-<ts>.zip  + .sha256
```

Both scripts run the dump *inside* the running compose container (so you need
no Postgres/ClickHouse client on the host), write a SHA-256 manifest next to the
artifact, and copy the artifact **off-box** into the output directory you pass —
that off-box file is exactly what the restore scripts consume. For a non-dev
deployment, override the env vars the scripts read: `COMPOSE_FILE` (default
`deploy/compose/dev.yml`), `PG_SERVICE`/`PGUSER`/`PGDATABASE`, and
`CH_SERVICE`/`CH_USER`/`CH_PASSWORD`/`CH_DB`.

Scheduled backups: `deploy/backup/` has a compose overlay for host cron and k8s
CronJob examples (digest-pinned images, credentials sourced from a secret).
A reasonable cadence: nightly, retain 7 daily + 4 weekly, and stagger Postgres
and ClickHouse so they don't contend (the shipped chart schedules them at 02:00
and 02:30).

**ClickHouse prerequisites.** The server must (1) allow writing backups to its
`/backups` path — `deploy/compose/clickhouse-backups.xml` (mounted by the dev
stack) is the `<backups><allowed_path>` drop-in; mount the equivalent plus a
`/backups` volume in production — and (2) be able to **write** that volume as the
`clickhouse` user (uid 101). A fresh volume mounts root-owned, so the dev/compose
scripts `chmod 1777 /backups` via a best-effort root exec; in Kubernetes set the
ClickHouse server pod's `securityContext.fsGroup: 101` (or pre-chown the PVC)
instead.

At larger scale, move Postgres to pgBackRest / WAL archiving for point-in-time
recovery, and ClickHouse to incremental `BACKUP … SETTINGS base_backup = …`. The
scripts here are the supported baseline and the contract the drill verifies.

## Restoring

**Both restore scripts are destructive: they drop and recreate the database.**
Stop the control plane first — agents store-and-forward (buffer locally) while
it is down, so no probe results are lost.

```sh
# 1. Stop probectl-control. Agents buffer; the UI is down from here.

# 2a. If the Postgres backup is ENCRYPTED (.dump.pbk), decrypt it first. This
#     needs the ORIGINAL envelope key — a fresh node only needs that one key:
PROBECTL_ENVELOPE_KEY=<base64 KEK> \
  probectl-control backup-open < postgres-probectl-<ts>.dump.pbk > postgres-probectl-<ts>.dump

# 2b. Verify + restore Postgres (drops + recreates, pg_restore from stdin):
./scripts/restore_postgres.sh   /srv/probectl-backups/postgres-probectl-<ts>.dump

# 3. Verify + restore ClickHouse (copies the artifact back into the server, drops, RESTORE):
./scripts/restore_clickhouse.sh /srv/probectl-backups/clickhouse-probectl-<ts>.zip

# 4. Start probectl-control. On boot it re-runs the Postgres migrations
#    idempotently; the restored probectl_ch_migrations ledger keeps the
#    ClickHouse schema state consistent with the restored data.

# 5. Sanity-check: /readyz is green; a tenant-scoped query returns pre-incident
#    data; the audit chain verifies (the WORM verify job also re-checks the
#    exported provider chain against object storage).
```

The `backup-open` step is only for the encrypted `.dump.pbk` artifacts the chart
CronJob produces; a plain `.dump` from `backup_postgres.sh` goes straight to
`restore_postgres.sh`. If the `.sha256` manifest sits next to the artifact, both
restore scripts verify it automatically before touching the database, and abort
on mismatch.

## RPO / RTO expectations

- **RPO** (how much data you can lose) = the backup cadence — 24 h with the
  example nightly cron. Tighten the schedule (or add WAL archiving) for less. The
  WORM audit exports run on their own interval, so they are not lost with the DB.
- **RTO** (how long a restore takes):
  - *Small / dev-sized:* minutes — usually single-digit seconds at drill size.
    The CI drill measures the real number on every run and prints
    `backup Ns, restore Ms`.
  - *Medium / large:* dominated by the ClickHouse volume — budget roughly
    `artifact size ÷ disk throughput` plus ~2 min of orchestration. Run a
    production-shaped drill and record the number below.

| Date | Environment | Data size | Backup time | Restore time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _continuous_ | CI drill (dev compose, marker-sized) | KBs | see job log | see job log | `backup-drill` job, every CI run |
| _pending_ | reference hardware (M/L-shaped) | — | — | — | run `make backup-restore-drill` against the loaded stack |

## The drill (executed, not aspirational)

```sh
make backup-restore-drill
```

This seeds nonce-marked rows in **both** stores (137 rows in Postgres, 251 in
ClickHouse), backs them up, **drops both databases**, restores from the off-box
artifacts, then asserts every marker row survived — both the count *and* the
nonce — and prints the measured backup/restore times. It runs against the dev
compose stack, exits non-zero on any divergence, and runs in CI on every run
(the `backup-drill` job), so the restore path cannot silently rot. Run it
against staging after any storage-layer change.
