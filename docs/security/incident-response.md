# Incident response plan

How a probectl security incident is detected, triaged, handled, evidenced, and
disclosed. Companion to [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) (reporting intake +
coordinated disclosure) and [threat-model.md](threat-model.md). Two scopes, kept
deliberately distinct:

- **Product/vendor incidents** — a vulnerability or compromise in probectl
  code, releases, or build infrastructure. Vendor-led; affects all
  deployments.
- **Deployment incidents** — a compromise inside one operator's
  installation. Operator-led under their own IR; probectl's job is to give
  them the evidence tooling and this playbook's deployment sections.

## 1. Severity matrix

| Sev | Definition | Examples | Acknowledge | Mitigation target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEV-1** | Cross-tenant data exposure (the declared highest-severity failure — tenant isolation is the outermost boundary); RCE in agent/control plane; compromised release artifact or signing path | tenant A reads B; malicious artifact signed | 4h | fix or kill-switch ≤ 24h; advisory ≤ 72h |
| **SEV-2** | Auth/RBAC bypass within a tenant; audit-chain integrity break; secret exposure; AI egress gate bypass | consent gate skipped; WORM verify fails | 24h | ≤ 7 days |
| **SEV-3** | Vulnerability with significant mitigating factors; DoS of a plane; dependency CVE in a reachable path | fairness bypass; exploitable parser crash | 72h | next patch release |
| **SEV-4** | Hardening gap, defense-in-depth finding, non-reachable dep CVE | scanner findings | 7 days | scheduled |

Cross-tenant anything starts at SEV-1 until proven otherwise. When in
doubt, classify up.

## 2. Roles

Solo-founder reality, stated plainly: the **maintainer is Incident Commander,
investigator, and fixer**. The compensating structure is this written plan;
predefined external deputies (counsel for notification-duty questions; the
affected operator's security team for deployment incidents — co-responders by
design, since they hold the infrastructure); and an immutable trail (the signed
WORM audit export, see [../hardening.md](../hardening.md) §0b) so every action is
reviewable after the fact. The role table will be re-cut at the first security
hire.

| Role | Holder today | Duties |
|---|---|---|
| Incident Commander | maintainer | declare sev, run timeline, own comms |
| Investigator/fixer | maintainer (+ operator's team for deployment scope) | root cause, patch, verify |
| Counsel | external (engaged per incident) | notification obligations, advisory wording |

## 3. Response flow

1. **Intake.** A report through the SECURITY.md channels (private advisory /
   `security.txt` contact), a CI security gate (`security-scan.yml`), the WORM
   chain-verification alarm, or an operator report.
2. **Declare + log.** Assign a severity; open a private timeline doc; record UTC
   timestamps for every action from this point on.
3. **Contain.**
   - *Product scope:* pull or revoke the affected artifacts (cosign identities
     make "which artifact" provable) and gate the release lane.
   - *Deployment scope:* the operator isolates per the runbooks — agents
     halt-on-error via the rollout machinery, credentials rotate, and any
     `insecure` override is audited.
4. **Preserve evidence — before remediation mutates state.**
   - Export the audit chains: the provider stream's **signed WORM segments** are
     already off-database and chain-verified (`internal/audit/worm.go`); snapshot
     the tenant streams.
   - Run `scripts/backup_postgres.sh` and `scripts/backup_clickhouse.sh` to
     capture store state with SHA-256 manifests.
   - Generate a support bundle (`internal/support`) for config/version posture.
   - Hash and retain the agent binaries/objects in question, comparing against
     the baked-in integrity manifest and the release signatures.
5. **Eradicate + recover.** Fix forward; release through the normal lane (the
   red-CI refusal stays on); upgrade the fleet as **staged waves of signed
   artifacts with halt-on-error** — an emergency changes the wave sizes, never
   the verification.
6. **Notify** (§4) and **disclose** (§5).
7. **Post-incident review** within 7 days: timeline, root cause, a tracked
   follow-up for every systemic gap found, and a re-review of the threat model
   if a trust boundary was involved.

## 4. Customer notification

The self-hosted nuance: the vendor cannot see deployments, so notification means
telling **operators** what to check and what to ship, fast.

- **Channels:** GitHub Security Advisory (the canonical record) plus release
  notes; direct contact for known enterprise/MSP operators.
- **SEV-1:** an initial notice within **72h of confirmation**, even if
  incomplete — affected versions, severity, interim mitigations, and indicators
  of compromise (how an operator checks *their own* audit chains and registry for
  the pattern). Update cadence at least every 72h until resolved.
- **SEV-2:** notice with the fix release.
- **Content discipline:** facts only — affected versions, the upgrade path
  ([../ops/fleet-rollout.md](../ops/fleet-rollout.md)), and verification steps
  ([../ops/verify-artifacts.md](../ops/verify-artifacts.md)). MSP operators
  re-notify *their* tenants under their own obligations; the per-tenant audit
  trail gives them the evidence to do it.

## 5. Disclosure

Coordinated disclosure per [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md): reporter
credit, advisory published when a fix is available, CVE requested via
GitHub for qualifying issues. Embargo target ≤ 90 days, shorter when
exploitation is observed.

## 6. Drill

Tabletop this plan twice yearly (one product-scope, one
deployment-scope using the backup/failover drills as the recovery legs)
and after any SEV-1/2. Record outcomes in the review log below.

| Version | Date | Change |
