# Dependency policy

## The idea in one line

Every piece of third-party code probectl uses is **pinned to an exact version,
verified cryptographically, and upgraded deliberately by a human**. A floating
version (`@latest`, an unpinned base image, a loosely-ranged package) is a
supply-chain input that nobody reviewed — so probectl doesn't allow any. This page
is the map of *where* the pins live and *what* enforces them.

Why so strict? probectl is self-hosted software that handles tenant data and, in
the eBPF agent, runs code in the kernel. A compromised or surprise-broken
dependency is a security and availability risk, not just a build annoyance. Pin
exactly, verify, upgrade on purpose.

## How everything is pinned

| Surface | Mechanism | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| Go modules | exact versions in [`go.mod`](../go.mod), checksums in `go.sum` (verified against the Go checksum database on download) | `go build` fails on any checksum mismatch |
| Dev / codegen tools (buf, protoc-gen-go / -go-grpc, golangci-lint, govulncheck) | exact versions at the top of the [`Makefile`](../Makefile); installed as Go modules (so they're checksum-verified) — never `@latest`, never a curl-pipe install | the `proto` job's generated-code drift check; the supply-pins gate |
| GitHub Actions | full commit-SHA pins (not `@v3` tags) | `scripts/check_action_pins.sh` (the `action-pins` CI job) |
| Container images (compose, Helm, CI services) | digest pins (`@sha256:...`) on infrastructure images; release-tag pins on probectl's own | the supply-pins gate (no `:latest` under `deploy/`) + review + the scheduled security scan |
| npm (`web/`, `browser-worker/`) | lockfiles + `npm ci` | `npm audit` gate in the `web` and `security-scan` jobs |
| Go toolchain | the `go` directive in `go.mod` (exact patch), a verified upstream release | see [`build/toolchain.md`](build/toolchain.md) |

The supply-pins gate (`scripts/check_supply_pins.sh`, run by the `action-pins`
job) is the backstop that mechanically fails the build on a floating reference:
a `:latest` image ref anywhere under `deploy/`, a `go install` in CI or the
`Makefile` without an exact `@vX.Y.Z`, or a `pip install` without exact `==`
pins, `--require-hashes`, or `--no-deps`.

## Upgrade cadence

- **Human-driven, never automated.** Pins are bumped by a person who reads the
  release notes — there is no auto-update bot opening batched dependency PRs.
  Each bump lands as **its own pull request** through the **full** gate set
  (unit/integration tests, the isolation suites, fuzz-smoke, and the eBPF
  kernel-matrix where relevant). Never batched, never auto-merged.
- **Security releases** are handled out-of-band on the same gates. `govulncheck`
  and Trivy also run on a weekly schedule
  ([`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`](../.github/workflows/security-scan.yml))
  **and** on every PR, so a newly-disclosed vulnerability in an *unchanged* pin
  goes red on its own — you don't have to be mid-upgrade to find out.
- **Tool pins** (the `Makefile` block) are bumped deliberately and committed
  *together with their effects* — e.g. a protobuf-plugin bump ships with the
  regenerated `internal/gen` tree in the same commit, because the `proto` job
  fails if the committed generated code doesn't match the pinned plugins.

## Risk register: pre-1.0 dependencies on privileged paths

Most dependencies are stable, post-1.0 libraries. A couple sit on sensitive paths
and earn an explicit note.

### `cilium/ebpf` v0.21.0 — the one that matters

The eBPF agent loads kernel programs through `cilium/ebpf`, which is **pre-1.0**:
its API contract explicitly allows breaking changes between minor versions. It
sits on probectl's most privileged path — the `bpf()` syscall, `CAP_BPF`.

Why this dependency is accepted, with eyes open:

- It is the de-facto-standard pure-Go eBPF library, maintained by the Cilium org
  and used in production by Cilium / Tetragon / Inspektor-Gadget at far larger
  scale than probectl. The only more-"mature" alternative is a cgo dependency on
  libbpf, which brings its own costs.
- **Pre-1.0 here means API instability, not kernel-safety instability.** The
  kernel verifier — not the library — is the safety boundary for what a loaded
  program is allowed to do, and probectl's programs are observe-only, with a CI
  gate (`internal/ebpf/observeonly_test.go`) enforcing that invariant
  independently of the library.
- The blast radius of a bad upgrade is **availability of the eBPF plane** (the
  agent fails to *load* programs), not data corruption or privilege escalation.
  Load failures are loud (lockdown explainers, attach-failure metrics) and the
  agent degrades to fixture/disabled mode rather than crashing the host.

Controls specific to this dependency:

1. **Exact pin** in `go.mod` (`v0.21.0`), checksum-verified like everything else.
2. **Kernel-matrix CI** — every change, including a `cilium/ebpf` bump, *loads and
   runs* the real programs across the supported LTS kernel range under QEMU. An
   API or behavior break surfaces there, in CI, not on a customer's host.
3. **Digest-verified embedded objects** — the loader refuses tampered or stale BPF
   objects before any kernel call, independent of the library version.
4. **Upgrade rule** — treat a minor-version bump of this library with the same
   care as a kernel bump: read the release notes for verifier/loader changes, and
   require kernel-matrix + fuzz-smoke + the agent-overhead bench green.
5. **1.0 watch** — when `cilium/ebpf` tags v1.x, move to it in its own PR and drop
   this caveat from the page.

### Other notable pins

- `gosnmp` (`v1.43.2`, device polling — *untrusted* device input): fuzzed via
  `FuzzSNMPPoll` (`internal/device/snmp_fuzz_test.go`); a malformed device
  response must never panic the agent.
- OTLP protobufs (`go.opentelemetry.io/proto`): wire-compatibility on probectl's
  *own* schemas is governed by the `proto` job's breaking-change gate; OTLP ingest
  is fuzzed for parse safety.

## When NOT to add a dependency

The default is **no**. A new dependency has to clear all of:

- a maintained upstream,
- a license compatible with the open-core editions model (see
  [`editions.md`](editions.md)),
- no phone-home behavior (a
  [non-negotiable](../CONTRIBUTING.md#non-negotiables)),
- and a note in the PR naming what it replaces.

**Crypto never comes from a new dependency** — it goes through `internal/crypto`
only, so a FIPS-validated module can be compiled in (also a
[non-negotiable](../CONTRIBUTING.md#non-negotiables); a CI lint guard rejects
primitive imports elsewhere). And adding an external dependency is a design
discussion *before* the code, not a fait accompli in a feature PR — open the
discussion first (see [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Deploy-time pinning (operators)

The repo pins what *it* controls; operators should pin what *they* deploy:

- **Images:** the shipped compose and Helm reference a pinned release tag, never
  `:latest`, and Dockerfiles digest-pin their base images. For maximum
  immutability, digest-pin the images you deploy:

  ```sh
  docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' <image>
  ```

- **Python (the analyzer):** the dependency set is **hash-locked** in
  `analyzer/requirements-dev.lock` (generated with
  `uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra dev --generate-hashes`). CI installs it
  with `--require-hashes` and refuses any drift between the lock and
  `pyproject.toml`. Standalone tools (`ruff`, `black`, `pyyaml`, `uv` itself) are
  exact-pinned in the workflow.

## Software bill of materials (SBOM)

Every CI run produces a **CycloneDX SBOM** of the Go module graph
(`probectl-sbom.cdx.json`) via the `sbom` job, which installs `cyclonedx-gomod`
pinned and checksum-verified (`go install ...@v1.7.0`) — no third-party action.
The SBOM is uploaded as a build artifact (retained 90 days) alongside the scan
outputs, so the dependency posture is always evidenced, not asserted. Releases
additionally ship a signed SPDX SBOM as a release asset (see
[`releasing.md`](releasing.md)).

The human-readable, per-module license inventory is
[`third-party-licenses.md`](third-party-licenses.md) plus [`../NOTICE`](../NOTICE),
regenerated by `scripts/gen_third_party.sh`.
