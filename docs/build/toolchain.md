# Go toolchain provenance

## What this is

When you run `go build`, *something* has to be the Go compiler. A **toolchain**
is that something as one versioned unit: the compiler, the standard library,
and the `go` tool itself, released together under one version number. This
page is about **which Go that is, where it comes from, and how we know it
wasn't tampered with**. The short version: probectl builds with the **official
upstream Go release**, pinned to one exact **patch version** (the third number
in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — the level that carries only fixes), downloaded and
cryptographically verified the same way any Go dependency is. There is no
custom, forked, or vendored compiler hiding in this repo.

The version is named in two places that are kept in lockstep:

- [`go.mod`](../../go.mod) — the main module's manifest (the file that names a
  Go module and pins its dependencies) — `go 1.26.4`. This is the
  language/version floor for the main module.
- [`go.work`](../../go.work) — the workspace file that ties the repo's modules
  together for local builds (see [`development.md`](../development.md)) —
  `go 1.26.4` **and** an explicit `toolchain go1.26.4` line. (See "Why the
  explicit toolchain line" below — it is not redundant.)

## How it works

- **Acquisition.** A `go` directive that names a version newer than the running
  Go triggers Go's *toolchain management* — the ability (since Go 1.21) of the
  installed `go` tool to fetch and run a *different*, newer toolchain on
  demand: it downloads the named toolchain from the canonical module mirror
  (`proxy.golang.org`) exactly like it fetches any module, then verifies it
  against the **public Go checksum database** (`sum.golang.org`) — an
  append-only public ledger recording the hash of every Go module and toolchain
  ever published — before it ever runs. Think of that database as a notary's
  ledger held in everyone's hands at once: your download must hash to exactly
  the entry the whole world can see, so nobody can hand *you* a special
  compiler without forking reality for everyone else. A swapped, corrupted, or
  man-in-the-middled toolchain fails that checksum and refuses to execute — the
  build stops instead of silently using an untrusted compiler.

- **Pinning.** Because the directive names the *exact patch* (`1.26.4`, not a
  loose `1.26`), every developer machine resolves to the same compiler. The
  workflows that build and gate shipped artifacts pin their `setup-go` to the
  same patch (`GO_VERSION: "1.26.4"` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
  `release.yml`), and the `go` directive is the floor everywhere else — a
  machine running an older Go fetches and checksum-verifies `1.26.4` before it
  compiles anything.

- **Why this patch level.** `1.26.4` is pinned *forward* deliberately: it carries
  upstream **standard-library security fixes** (GO-2026-5037 in `crypto/x509`,
  GO-2026-5039 in `net/textproto` — the IDs are Go vulnerability-database
  advisories) that `govulncheck` (Go's official vulnerability scanner, which
  reports known CVEs in your dependencies *and* in the standard library of the
  Go version you build with) would otherwise flag. Bumps land through the
  normal pull-request + green-CI path, never out of band.

## Why it's built this way

- **Exact-patch pinning keeps `govulncheck` honest.** `govulncheck` attributes
  standard-library vulnerabilities by Go version. A bare `go 1.26` scans as
  `1.26.0` and would false-flag every already-patched stdlib CVE; naming `1.26.4`
  makes the scan reflect the real, patched toolchain. (This is also why `go.mod`
  carries the patch version — see the comment at the top of `go.mod`.)

- **Why the explicit `toolchain` line in `go.work`.** The patched stdlib is the
  *minimum* every build must use. `go.work` must not name an older Go than the
  modules' `go.mod`, or Go rejects the workspace whenever it cannot auto-resolve
  a newer toolchain — which is exactly the case under `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` (the
  setting that forbids Go from downloading any other toolchain: whatever is
  installed is all there is), the mode the FIPS distribution build
  (`make build-fips`) and any offline or air-gapped build runs in (no network
  means no toolchain download — the local Go either satisfies the floor or the
  build refuses). Keeping the `go.work` `go` line and `toolchain` line in sync
  with `go.mod` is what stops those builds from breaking.

- **No vendored or forked toolchain exists in this repository.** Provenance is
  upstream-official plus checksum-database-verified — full stop. That is the
  point: anyone auditing the build can reproduce it from a public, signed
  toolchain rather than trusting a binary we shipped.
