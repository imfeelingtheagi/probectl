# Remote-AI egress: what leaves the network, and the three gates

## What this page is

**Egress** is data leaving your network — any byte that travels from
infrastructure you control to a machine you don't. probectl's default AI has
none: it is **air-gapped**, meaning the deterministic builtin synthesizer, and
a **loopback** Ollama/vLLM (a local model server reached at
`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, where the call never crosses a network interface),
both run entirely on your own hardware and send nothing out. You could unplug
the WAN cable and the AI would keep answering.

A **remote model** changes that. The moment you configure a remote model
endpoint — `openai`, `anthropic`, or an `ollama` pointed at a non-loopback
host — the sovereignty story changes: to answer a question, some data leaves
your network and lands on a computer someone else operates.

This page is the **disclosure** of exactly what leaves, and the three
independent controls that stand in front of it — two locks (nothing leaves
until *both* the operator and the tenant have said yes) and a camera (every
call that does leave is recorded). It's written to be attached to a **Data
Processing Agreement** (DPA) — the contract governing how a third party may
process data on your behalf: if you connect a cloud model, this is the
document your privacy/legal review reads.

## Exactly what is sent, per remote call

One HTTPS POST to the endpoint you configured, containing:

- the user's **question text**, verbatim¹;
- per **evidence item** — one of the signals the query engine already judged
  relevant to the question (a test result, a BGP event, an incident, …), at
  most `PROBECTL_AI_MAX_EVIDENCE` of them, default **50**: its **ID**,
  **plane** (which telemetry family it came from: network / bgp / flow /
  device / ebpf / incident / …), **severity**, **title**, **summary**, and
  **timestamp**¹;
- the **system prompt** (static probectl text instructing the model to use
  only the evidence and cite it) and the **model name**.

**Never sent:** API keys or tokens (the API key authenticates the call itself,
traveling in a request header; it is supplied as a secret reference — see
`docs/secrets.md` — not embedded in any payload), raw telemetry rows, packet
payloads, database contents, or anything outside the caller's tenant + RBAC
scope (a **tenant** is one isolated customer/organization in the deployment;
**RBAC** is role-based access control — the caller's permission set). The
evidence is gathered **tenant-first** through the semantic query engine
(`docs/ai-query.md`) before a model ever sees it, so off-scope data can't be
in the prompt to begin with — a model cannot leak what was never fetched.

¹ **After the redaction pass** (`internal/ai/redact.go`). **Redaction** means
masking sensitive values inside text before it leaves, and it runs in three
tiers: secrets (bearer/authorization values, `key=value` credentials, AWS
access key IDs, PEM blocks) are **always** masked — no setting turns that off;
IP addresses and free-text PII (emails, phone numbers, MAC addresses) are
masked **by default** (`PROBECTL_AI_REDACT_IPS`, `PROBECTL_AI_REDACT_PII`);
hostnames (`PROBECTL_AI_REDACT_HOSTNAMES` — kept by default, because the
hostname is usually the very thing you're asking about) and any
operator-supplied custom patterns (`PROBECTL_AI_REDACT_PATTERNS`,
`;;`-separated regexes — `;;` because regexes routinely contain commas; one
bad pattern refuses the whole config, fail closed) are masked **per policy** —
all before anything leaves. Masking is *deterministic per value*: the same IP
becomes the same token every time, the way a court transcript names every
appearance of the same person "Witness A" — the story stays followable, the
identity never appears. The model can still correlate ("this address appears
in both signals") without ever seeing the real value.

## One gate, three doors

Every such POST passes one checkpoint on its way out. The `EgressGate`
(`internal/ai/egressgate.go`) is a single object bundling consent + redaction
+ audit, and it guards every path that sends tenant data to an external AI —
think of an airport terminal with three departure doors but one customs desk:
whichever door you came through, the same desk applies the same checks and
writes the same manifest, and the manifest records *categories* of goods,
never their contents. The three doors:

- the **remote RCA model** (`docs/ai-rca.md`) — RCA is root-cause analysis,
  the Ask pipeline;
- **MCP tool results** (`docs/mcp.md`) — MCP, the Model Context Protocol, is
  how external AI apps call tools; an MCP caller *is* an external AI client,
  so the data tools return to it is egress just as surely as a prompt is;
- the **test-authoring model** (`docs/ai-authoring.md`).

The audit event records which door it came through:
`surface = rca | mcp | author`.

The wiring is what makes this a guarantee rather than a convention. Every gate
is built by **one constructor** in the control plane, so every surface draws
the *same* per-tenant consent source (`tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress`),
the *same* redaction policy, and the *same* audit sink — no surface carries
its own copy that could drift. And there is no gate-less path: the MCP server
*requires* a gate to construct (a nil gate denies every call), and a static
test (`TestNoAIClientOutsideGate`, `internal/ai/egressgate_test.go`) walks the
AI subsystem's sources and fails CI if any file beyond the one approved model
adapter (and the inbound MCP HTTP transport, which serves and never dials out)
gains an HTTP client. A future surface *cannot* quietly route around the gate
— it would fail the build first.

**Who governs the data once it leaves:** your agreement with the model
provider. probectl sets no retention terms on the remote side — it can't; the
bytes are on their disks now. DPA inputs, ready to copy: processor = the model
provider; data categories = the list above; transfer trigger = each `/v1/ai/*`
query by a consenting tenant; safeguards = TLS (hardened, cert-validating
client), the redaction pass, per-tenant consent, and a per-call audit trail.

## The three gates

Doors are where a request can come from; **gates** are what every request must
pass. All three must be satisfied. Each is independent, and each **fails
closed** — on any error, doubt, or missing piece the result is "deny", never
"allow and hope":

1. **Operator acknowledgment (boot-time, fail-closed).** The **operator** is
   whoever runs the deployment. A remote endpoint refuses to start until the
   operator sets, exactly:

   ```text
   PROBECTL_AI_EGRESS_ACK=yes-send-tenant-data-to-the-remote-model
   ```

   Config validation rejects a remote `PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT` without
   this phrase — the control plane won't boot. The ack is a full sentence on
   purpose: a `=true` flag gets flipped by a copied template or a default
   nobody read, but nobody types *yes-send-tenant-data-to-the-remote-model*
   without understanding what they just authorized — the value is its own
   warning label. Sending data off-network must be a deliberate operator
   decision, never a default that happens because someone filled in an
   endpoint.

2. **Per-tenant consent (call-time, default deny).** **Consent** here is a
   recorded opt-in, stored per tenant. Even with the operator's ack, each
   *tenant* must opt in — the operator runs the platform, but the telemetry
   belongs to the tenant, and a platform-wide switch can't speak for them.
   The bit is `tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress` (migration
   `0037_governance_ai_egress.sql`); it defaults to **false**, and the
   analyzer refuses remote synthesis for a non-consenting tenant with
   `ErrEgressDenied`. Default-deny is the only safe polarity: no consent row,
   no database, or any read error all resolve to "denied" — fail closed,
   never fail open — so a database outage can never silently become a data
   export. The builtin and loopback-local paths are **exempt** and keep
   working for everyone: a loopback call never leaves the machine, so there
   is nothing to consent *to* — gating it would only punish the sovereign
   path this whole system exists to protect.

3. **Audit (every call).** An **audit log** is an append-only,
   tamper-evident record — entries can be added, never silently altered or
   removed. Each allowed remote call appends `ai.remote_egress` to the
   tenant's tamper-evident audit stream: the endpoint, the model, the
   evidence count, and the **data categories (planes)** that left — never the
   content itself. Categories-not-contents is deliberate: an audit trail that
   copied the payload would *be* a second copy of the sensitive data — the
   customs manifest lists the crates, not the serial numbers. (On the MCP
   surface there's also an `mcp.tool_call` audit line per call, recording
   allow/deny and the reason.)

## Turning it on

```sh
# 1. operator acknowledgment (boot-time)
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT=https://api.anthropic.com
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_TOKEN=vault:ai/anthropic#key   # a secret reference (docs/secrets.md)
PROBECTL_AI_EGRESS_ACK=yes-send-tenant-data-to-the-remote-model
```

(Per-provider model wiring, including the local Ollama/vLLM recipes that need
**none** of this, is in [`ai-rca.md`](ai-rca.md) → *Copy-paste recipes*.)

**2. Then consent each tenant that may use it.** The consent bit is
`tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress` (default **false**), and there are two ways
to set it depending on your edition:

- **Enterprise / Provider (the governance feature):** the governance console or
  its API —

  ```sh
  curl -sS --cacert ca.crt -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVIDER_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://probectl.example.com/provider/v1/tenants/<tenant-uuid>/governance \
    -d '{"ai_remote_egress": true}'
  ```

- **Core / community:** the governance *API and console* are part of the
  commercial governance feature, so a core deployment sets the bit directly in
  its own database (you are the operator the error message tells users to ask):

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO tenant_governance (tenant_id, ai_remote_egress, updated_at, updated_by)
  VALUES ('<tenant-uuid>', true, now(), 'dba')
  ON CONFLICT (tenant_id) DO UPDATE SET ai_remote_egress = true, updated_at = now();
  ```

In a single-tenant deployment that's just the one tenant; in a multi-tenant/MSP
deployment each tenant is consented individually.

**What "not yet consented" looks like:** a remote model with the gate closed
fails the Ask/authoring/MCP call with exactly —

> `ai: this tenant has not consented to sending data to a remote model
> (tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress; ask an operator) — the air-gapped builtin
> and loopback local models need no consent`

## Remote-provider resilience

A remote model adds a dependency probectl cannot fix: someone else's server. A
slow or down provider must degrade RCA gracefully — never take it down. When a
model is configured, its call path is wrapped by `ResilientModel`
(`internal/ai/model_resilient.go`), which adds:

- **a circuit breaker** (`internal/breaker`) — named for the electrical part:
  after repeated faults it cuts the circuit so the fault stops consuming
  everything behind it, then re-probes after a cool-down. Here, **3**
  consecutive failures open the circuit for **30s**, so calls short-circuit
  instead of stacking up timeouts against a dead provider;
- **a timeout**: the configured model timeout (`PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_TIMEOUT`) is
  enforced at the wrapper via context deadline, regardless of the HTTP client's
  own settings — the ceiling holds even if an adapter misconfigures its client;
- **a response cache**: an identical question + evidence within **10 minutes**
  is answered without a provider round-trip (up to 256 entries). The subtlety:
  evidence IDs are per-session random, so the cache keys on **content**, and
  cached citations are remapped onto the current run's IDs — so citation
  grounding still validates them;
- **graceful degradation**: on breaker-open / timeout / error, the
  **air-gapped builtin** answers instead. The answer is clearly marked — it
  carries `degraded: true` and the root cause is prefixed `PARTIAL RESULT —
  remote model unavailable (…)`, with the builtin's own grounded citations. An
  answer always comes back; it never silently fails.

The consent gate is unchanged by any of this: a remote-*configured* deployment
requires tenant consent before any synthesis — **including cache hits and
fallback answers**. The strict reading is that the *configuration* (not the
individual network packet) is the consent subject: a cached answer is
remote-derived content, and a degraded answer exists only because a remote
model is configured, so neither becomes a side door for a non-consenting
tenant. The builtin default path is never wrapped — there's nothing to break.

## What it deliberately does not do

- **It does not turn egress on for you.** Three explicit decisions (operator ack +
  per-tenant consent, with audit) stand between "endpoint configured" and "data
  leaves."
- **It does not send raw telemetry, secrets, or off-scope data.** Evidence is
  scoped, reduced to a small set of display fields, and redacted before egress.
- **It does not assume the cloud.** The default and the recommended sovereign path
  are fully local; everything here applies *only* once you opt into a remote model.
