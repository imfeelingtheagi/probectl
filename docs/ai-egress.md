# Remote-AI egress: what leaves the network, and the three gates

## What this page is

probectl's default AI is **air-gapped**: the deterministic builtin synthesizer, and
a loopback Ollama/vLLM, both run entirely on your own hardware and send nothing
out. The moment you configure a **remote** model endpoint — `openai`, `anthropic`,
or an `ollama` pointed at a non-loopback host — the sovereignty story changes: to
answer a question, some data leaves your network.

This page is the **disclosure** of exactly what leaves, and the three independent
controls that stand in front of it. It's written to be attached to a Data
Processing Agreement (DPA): if you connect a cloud model, this is the document your
privacy/legal review reads.

## Exactly what is sent, per remote call

One HTTPS POST to the endpoint you configured, containing:

- the user's **question text**, verbatim¹;
- per evidence item (at most `PROBECTL_AI_MAX_EVIDENCE`, default **50**): its **ID**,
  **plane** (network / bgp / flow / device / ebpf / incident / …), **severity**,
  **title**, **summary**, and **timestamp**¹;
- the **system prompt** (static probectl text instructing the model to use only the
  evidence and cite it) and the **model name**.

**Never sent:** API keys or tokens (the API key authenticates the call itself; it
is supplied as a secret reference — see `docs/secrets.md` — not embedded in any
payload), raw telemetry rows, packet payloads, database contents, or anything
outside the caller's tenant + RBAC scope. The evidence is gathered **tenant-first**
through the semantic query engine (`docs/ai-query.md`) before a model ever sees it,
so off-scope data can't be in the prompt to begin with.

¹ **After the redaction pass** (`internal/ai/redact.go`): secrets are **always**
masked; IP addresses and free-text PII (emails, phone numbers, MAC addresses) are
masked **by default**; hostnames and any operator-supplied custom patterns
(`PROBECTL_AI_REDACT_PATTERNS`, `;;`-separated regexes) are masked **per policy** —
all before anything leaves. Masking is *deterministic per value*: the same IP
becomes the same token every time, so the model can still correlate ("this address
appears in both signals") without ever seeing the real value.

## One gate, three doors

The same `EgressGate` (`internal/ai/egressgate.go`) — consent + redaction + audit
— guards every path that sends tenant data to an external AI:

- the **remote RCA model** (`docs/ai-rca.md`),
- **MCP tool results** (an MCP caller *is* an external AI client; `docs/mcp.md`),
- the **test-authoring model** (`docs/ai-authoring.md`).

The audit event records which door it came through: `surface = rca | mcp | author`.
Every gate is built by **one constructor** in the control plane, so every surface
draws the *same* per-tenant consent source (`tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress`),
the *same* redaction policy, and the *same* audit sink — no surface carries its own
copy that could drift. And there is no gate-less path: the MCP server *requires* a
gate to construct (a nil gate denies every call), and a static test
(`TestNoAIClientOutsideGate`, `internal/ai/egressgate_test.go`) walks the AI
subsystem's sources and fails CI if any file beyond the one approved model adapter
(and the inbound MCP HTTP transport, which serves and never dials out) gains an
HTTP client. So a future surface *cannot* quietly route around the gate.

**Who governs the data once it leaves:** your agreement with the model provider.
probectl sets no retention terms on the remote side. DPA inputs, ready to copy:
processor = the model provider; data categories = the list above; transfer trigger
= each `/v1/ai/*` query by a consenting tenant; safeguards = TLS (hardened,
cert-validating client), the redaction pass, per-tenant consent, and a per-call
audit trail.

## The three gates

All three must be satisfied. Each is independent, and each fails closed.

1. **Operator acknowledgment (boot-time, fail-closed).** A remote endpoint refuses
   to start until the operator sets, exactly:

   ```text
   PROBECTL_AI_EGRESS_ACK=yes-send-tenant-data-to-the-remote-model
   ```

   Config validation rejects a remote `PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT` without this
   phrase. Sending data off-network must be a deliberate operator decision, never a
   default that happens because someone filled in an endpoint.

2. **Per-tenant consent (call-time, default deny).** Even with the operator's ack,
   each *tenant* must opt in. `tenant_governance.ai_remote_egress` (migration
   `0037_governance_ai_egress.sql`) defaults to **false**; the analyzer refuses
   remote synthesis for a non-consenting tenant with `ErrEgressDenied`. No
   consent row, no database, or any read error all resolve to "denied" — fail
   closed, never fail open. The builtin and loopback-local paths are **exempt** and
   keep working for everyone, because they don't egress anything.

3. **Audit (every call).** Each allowed remote call appends `ai.remote_egress` to
   the tenant's tamper-evident audit stream: the endpoint, the model, the evidence
   count, and the **data categories (planes)** that left — never the content
   itself. (On the MCP surface there's also an `mcp.tool_call` audit line per call,
   recording allow/deny and the reason.)

## Turning it on

```sh
# 1. operator acknowledgment (boot-time)
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT=https://api.anthropic.com
PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_TOKEN=vault:ai/anthropic#key   # a secret reference (docs/secrets.md)
PROBECTL_AI_EGRESS_ACK=yes-send-tenant-data-to-the-remote-model

# 2. then, per tenant that may use it, via the provider/MSP governance console:
#    PUT /provider/v1/tenants/{id}/governance  {"ai_remote_egress": true, ...}
```

The per-tenant consent toggle lives on the **provider/management plane** (the
governance route is part of the commercial provider console). In a single-tenant
deployment that's just the one tenant; in a multi-tenant/MSP deployment each tenant
is consented individually.

## Remote-provider resilience

A slow or down provider must degrade RCA gracefully — never take it down. When a
model is configured, its call path is wrapped by `ResilientModel`
(`internal/ai/model_resilient.go`), which adds:

- **a circuit breaker** (`internal/breaker`): **3** consecutive failures open the
  circuit for **30s**, so calls short-circuit instead of stacking up timeouts
  against a dead provider;
- **a timeout**: the configured model timeout (`PROBECTL_AI_MODEL_TIMEOUT`) is
  enforced at the wrapper via context deadline, regardless of the HTTP client's own
  settings;
- **a response cache**: an identical question + evidence within **10 minutes** is
  answered without a provider round-trip (up to 256 entries). Because evidence IDs
  are per-session random, the cache keys on **content**, and cached citations are
  remapped onto the current run's IDs — so citation grounding still validates them;
- **graceful degradation**: on breaker-open / timeout / error, the **air-gapped
  builtin** answers instead. The answer is clearly marked — it carries
  `degraded: true` and the root cause is prefixed `PARTIAL RESULT — remote model
  unavailable (…)`, with the builtin's own grounded citations. An answer always
  comes back; it never silently fails.

The consent gate is unchanged by any of this: a remote-*configured* deployment
requires tenant consent before any synthesis — **including cache hits and fallback
answers**. The strict reading is that the *configuration* (not the individual
network packet) is the consent subject, so even a cached or degraded answer in a
remote-configured deployment is gated. The builtin default path is never wrapped —
there's nothing to break.

## What it deliberately does not do

- **It does not turn egress on for you.** Three explicit decisions (operator ack +
  per-tenant consent, with audit) stand between "endpoint configured" and "data
  leaves."
- **It does not send raw telemetry, secrets, or off-scope data.** Evidence is
  scoped, reduced to a small set of display fields, and redacted before egress.
- **It does not assume the cloud.** The default and the recommended sovereign path
  are fully local; everything here applies *only* once you opt into a remote model.
