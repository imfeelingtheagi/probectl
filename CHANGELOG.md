## Unreleased — second-audit remediation (post-triage plan)

- Sprint 19: agent integrity, capabilities, resource caps, kernel matrix
  (EBPF-003..008). EBPF-003 decided per the triage rule: operator-
  supplied BPF objects are NOT supported — the embedded-digest chain
  (source → bpf2go → embed → U-014 manifest → cosign-signed binary,
  signature covering objects+manifest together) is the documented
  trust boundary, with a static tripwire test forcing the signature
  design if a filesystem/env load path ever appears. EBPF-004: the
  SHIPPED probectl-ebpf-agent image is now the LIVE -tags ebpf build
  (Dockerfile.ebpf: same bpf2go+gendigests path operators use;
  release.yml wired; the ebpf-image-live ci job extracts the image
  binary and fails unless Go build metadata records the tag) — fixture
  mode documented dev/test-only. EBPF-005: the capability probe checks
  CAP_PERFMON (attach/perf_event_open) separately from CAP_BPF (load),
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN implies both, with distinct actionable reasons — no
  more ready-then-fail-at-attach; CAP_NET_ADMIN documented NOT needed
  (no TC/XDP, observe-only). EBPF-006 confirmed closed (Sprint 0
  re-audit note + bpf_probe_write_user in the forbidden list).
  EBPF-007: systemd unit gains CPUQuota=100%, MemoryHigh=384M,
  MemoryMax=512M, TasksMax=128, IOWeight — mirroring the Helm limits.
  EBPF-008: kernel matrix broadened to arm64 (native ubuntu-24.04-arm
  runner; vimto can't cross-emulate) and a hardened entry raising
  lockdown to INTEGRITY inside the ephemeral VM and proving load+
  attach + probe truthfulness there (secure-boot distro kernel stays
  [needs infra] if the ci-kernel lacks the lockdown LSM).

- Sprint 18: eBPF TLS-capture scoping + kernel-side redaction
  (EBPF-001/002, RED-003). Uprobes on a shared libssl fire for every
  process on the host, so the fix lives IN THE KERNEL: sslsniff now
  checks an allowlist (scope_tgids/scope_cgroups maps) before copying
  a byte — a non-allowlisted process's plaintext never enters the ring
  buffer, and empty maps match nothing (load-time default = capture
  off). The allowlist is the THIRD consent gate: l7_capture_scope
  (pid:/exe:/cgroup: entries; a container IS a cgroup) must name the
  opted-in workloads or capture refuses to start — host-wide capture
  is not expressible. exe: entries re-resolve against /proc on a 10s
  ticker so restarts stay in scope. Redaction moved up a layer: the
  kernel capture window (capture_cfg; zero-initialized = length-only =
  fail-closed) bounds plaintext per chunk transiting the ring (headers
  ≤ l7_capture_kernel_window, default 1024; new "length" mode ships
  none; orig_len preserves true sizes and the D-001 len≤copied
  invariant), then decodeChunk (l7chunk.go — pure, the only entry from
  the ring) redacts the only surviving copy before any parser or
  forwarder. Tests: scope parse/resolve (fake procfs; cgroup-id =
  dir inode), triple-gate, decode-boundary redaction incl. hostile
  records, and a kernel-matrix gate (TestLiveScopeAllowlistAttach)
  proving a non-allowlisted openssl s_client yields ZERO events while
  an exe:-allowlisted one flows.

- Sprint 17: scale validation — everything-but-the-run (SCALE-002/015,
  DOCS-001/006). The benchmark set is complete: path-store write joins
  ingest (S14) and TSDB query (S16) — memory Save ~38ns and the
  Sprint 14 batched window ~102ns/op, zero-alloc steady state. The
  scale-gate drive set gains the VOLUME plane: DriveFlowPlane pushes
  4× the tier's results as NetFlow through the production FlowConsumer
  (verify/fairness/enrich seams) and fails on rejects or incomplete
  storage; `make scale-gate` now runs both planes. A nightly M-profile
  regression guard (`scale-gate-m` in nightly.yml) runs both planes
  plus the M-tier FULL-STACK gate against real Kafka + Prometheus —
  the standing SLO guard until the reference run. The live ring-buffer
  overhead harness (TestLiveOverheadReport, linux&&ebpf) loads+attaches
  the real BPF path, drives loopback traffic, and prints the OVERHEAD
  ROW for docs/agent-overhead.md; skips cleanly without privileges.
  Honesty preserved: the L/XL run and live numbers need reference
  hardware — tables stay `_pending_`, SLOs stay PROVISIONAL, register
  row stays OPEN (owner: iron) with the run now one command.

- Sprint 16: storage + OTLP plane (SCALE-006/010/014, ARCH-005). Path
  tables get retention: chmigrate v2 re-creates them with (tenant_id,
  day) partitioning — PARTITION BY is immutable in ClickHouse, and
  pre-GA the snapshot discard is deliberate (paths are re-discoverable)
  — plus a boot-applied delete-TTL (PROBECTL_PATH_RETENTION_DAYS,
  default 90, the flowstore pattern). The OTLP topic finally has a
  CONSUMER: externally-ingested metrics (gauge+sum; histograms counted
  and skipped until the Sprint 22 plane) land in the TSDB tenant-
  labeled exactly like native planes, with bounded label sets and a
  push→query round-trip test. The in-memory TSDB query is sub-linear:
  a per-metric position index (eviction advances a base offset; tenant
  erasure rebuilds) replaces the all-samples scan — one metric of 200
  answers in ~4.4µs. ARCH-005 lands EXACTLY as the volatile-stores ADR
  scoped it (founder decision: topology/detections rebuild-on-restart
  stands): ONLY operator silences/acks persist (alert_ops, RLS-forced),
  restored ops re-apply when their series fires after a restart
  (expired silences skipped), resolve deletes the row so restored
  state never outlives episode semantics — restart-survival test at
  the engine seam.

- Sprint 15: cardinality + fairness layer (SCALE-003/004/005/007/011).
  The cardinality limiter is BOUNDED: identities idle past 1h evict
  via an amortized sweep (live series refresh their slot; empty
  agents/tenants are removed; Evicted/ActiveSeries surfaced) — and
  cross-replica sharing is deliberately skipped (per-replica caps
  tolerate replicas×cap, vs a stateful dependency on the hot path —
  trade-off recorded). Fairness is bounded BY DEFAULT on every plane
  (results 1000/s, flow 10k/s, ingest 2MiB/s, device 2000/s per
  tenant); unlimited is now an explicit NEGATIVE opt-in — the
  fail-open doctrine is reversed. The device plane, verified to have
  neither, gains the fairness gate and its own cardinality cap. Bus
  partition keys become tenant|bucket with AGENT entropy: one large
  tenant spreads across up to 16 partitions while each agent's stream
  keeps FIFO (the ordering consumers actually rely on). Flow ASN/geo
  enrichment moves off the hot path: cache hits enrich inline (~87ns),
  misses queue a background warm pool and the record proceeds
  unenriched — graceful degrade under lag with shed warms counted
  (the old inline miss cost ~1.4ms per record). BenchmarkEnrich* +
  eviction/throttle/spread/device-cap tests ride the required suite.

- Sprint 14: ingest hot-path performance (SCALE-001/008/009/012/013).
  The consume path parallelizes: Kafka poll batches dispatch across
  key-sharded workers (PROBECTL_BUS_WORKERS, default 4) — per-key FIFO
  preserved, the loop waits for the batch so at-least-once semantics
  are unchanged — and the result pipeline decouples decode from the
  remote write through a bounded write stage (backpressure, retry+DLQ
  intact). Decode-once fan-out: six sidecar consumers (result views,
  threat-intel, TLS posture, NDR DNS, outage, RUM synthetic) now share
  ONE subscription and ONE unmarshal via the new ResultFan instead of
  six independent groups re-decoding every message (benchmarked ~5.8×
  less decode work; sinks treat the record as immutable). Heartbeats
  coalesce into one multi-row UPDATE per tenant per 2s window (was one
  UPDATE per RPC, fleet-linear); path discoveries batch cross-path —
  N paths inside a 100ms window cost one insert per table, with
  flush-before-read keeping read-your-write for the discover→view
  flow. The DEVICE plane now rides the same retry+DLQ contract as
  results (jittered backoff, original bytes to probectl.deadletter.
  device, loss only if the DLQ itself is down) — proven by a
  transient/permanent/DLQ-down decision-table test with the drop
  counter pinned at 0. BenchmarkIngest* suite added; nightly
  ingest-bench job uploads results (feeds the Sprint 17 baseline).

- Sprint 13: StreamConfig is now an ENFORCED deny (ARCH-003, within
  the standing U-044 ADR — founder decision: the RPC stays in the
  schema for wire compatibility). The old stub sent an empty epoch-0
  frame and held the stream open; the server now answers an immediate
  codes.Unimplemented citing docs/adr/config-push.md — no frame, no
  held stream — with a test that fails the build if a frame ever comes
  back, and a static test asserting the agent binary contains no
  client invocation. Zero proto change (buf-breaking stays green); the
  proto conformance test still sees the RPC in the schema; ADR
  addendum records the hardening and the audit finding it answers.

- Sprint 12: transport security (WIRE-003/004/005/006/007, RED-008).
  Revocation is now FED, not just checked: `probectl-control
  revoke-agent` + the audited admin API resolve an agent's issued
  serials + SPIFFE id from the Sprint 11 registry, persist the
  revocation (survives restarts), push the live handshake deny-list,
  and a 30s refresher converges CLI-side revocations; the SPIFFE
  dimension refuses even re-issued certs, and enrollment/rotation
  refuse revoked identities (no resurrection). TLS is mandatory for
  the control API: a non-loopback plaintext listener refuses to start
  without the explicit PROBECTL_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_HTTP opt-in (the Helm
  chart sets it — plaintext only behind its TLS-terminating ingress).
  One hardened TLS config now serves every probectl listener (API,
  OTLP, MCP — the bespoke weak config in main is gone) with a TLS 1.3
  floor across all probectl↔probectl endpoints (agent mTLS, enrollment
  client included); outbound probe clients (canary HTTP/DNS, gNMI)
  deliberately keep 1.2 for third-party interop, allowlisted in the
  new `unified-TLS` lint gate that fails the build on any bespoke
  tls.Config literal. Ingestion gains app-layer replay/freshness
  protection: results streams carry a timestamp+nonce envelope inside
  the authenticated channel — stale or replayed envelopes are refused
  (bounded per-agent nonce cache that refuses rather than evicts under
  flood), while store-and-forward of buffered results stays intact.
  Probe ca_file parameters are contained to an operator-allowlisted
  directory (traversal- and symlink-escape-proof; refused entirely
  when unconfigured). Also restores the no-stringbuilt-sql gate wiring
  in make lint-go (lost to an external edit after Sprint 7).

- Sprint 11: agent enrollment & SVID issuance — the trust root is now
  repo-managed (WIRE-002, RED-002, TENANT-103, ARCH-004; ADR
  founder-approved before code, docs/adr/agent-enrollment.md). One-time
  tenant-scoped join tokens (hash-at-rest, atomic single-use consume,
  1h expiry, revocable) bootstrap CSR-based issuance of 24h SPIFFE
  SVIDs from a root→intermediate→leaf hierarchy: the root key is shown
  once at `agent-ca init` for offline custody and never persisted; the
  issuing intermediate is sealed at rest via tenantcrypto. The SERVER
  sets the SPIFFE tenant claim from the TOKEN — an agent cannot request
  a tenant. Rotation proves the current identity (chain to our
  hierarchy + key-possession signature over the new CSR + issued-serial
  provenance) and can never change it; the agent runtime auto-rotates
  at 2/3 lifetime with hot-reloaded mTLS material (no restart). Mint
  surfaces: POST /v1/agents/enroll-tokens (admin RBAC, audited) +
  `probectl-control enroll-token`; bootstrap surface mounts OFF /v1
  (`/enroll/agent[/rotate]`), per-IP throttled, with `--ca-pin`
  first-contact server authentication (mismatch refuses, no TOFU). The
  Sprint 4 tenant binding now vouches for repo-issued identities only;
  every serial is recorded for Sprint 12 revocation feeding.
  Integration tests: happy path, replay rejection, wrong-tenant
  impossibility (incl. cross-tenant registry invisibility), rotation,
  foreign-CA + bad-proof rejection; client tests: pin mismatch, 0600
  identity dir, rotation-due policy; docs/agent/enrollment.md.

- Sprint 10: residual hardening (SEC-006/007/008, OPS-003/010). SSRF
  guard denies the full 0.0.0.0/8 "this network" block (Linux routes
  0.x.y.z to localhost) incl. v4-mapped smuggles, with per-range table
  tests across every blocked class. Non-dev compose REQUIRES
  operator-set secrets (`${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?}` — refuses to start
  unset; DR overlay reuses the env ref; .env.example ships empty).
  SCIM store errors return generic text (details logged server-side);
  /openapi.json is auth-gated and /version strips build detail for
  anonymous callers outside dev mode. CI now talks TLS to Postgres:
  every DB-backed job starts it under a per-run test CA and connects
  sslmode=verify-full (scripts/ci_pg_tls.sh); local-dev fallbacks
  documented.

- Sprint 9: auth/session/transport hardening (SEC-003/004/009,
  RED-007). The provider/operator login — the highest-privilege login
  — gets the U-024 brute-force brake: per-account + per-IP throttle,
  exponential lockout, 429 + Retry-After, lockouts audited to the
  provider stream. OIDC nonce is now ENFORCED on callback: minted at
  login into a transient cookie, compared against the verified ID
  token's nonce claim, fail closed on mismatch or missing cookie.
  Cookie Secure follows the DEPLOYMENT EDGE (PROBECTL_PUBLIC_TLS; the
  Helm chart sets it — cookies were previously not-Secure behind the
  TLS-terminating ingress). RED-007 verified: mcp-stdio authenticates
  PROBECTL_MCP_TOKEN before serving anything (pinned by test); the
  stdio local-trust model is documented in docs/mcp.md.

- Sprint 8: at-rest encryption is the shipped default (SEC-002,
  COMPLY-004). PROBECTL_ENVELOPE_KEY_FILE loads — or GENERATES and
  persists (0600) on first boot — the deployment KEK; compose points it
  at the new controldata volume with REQUIRE_AT_REST_ENCRYPTION=true
  (fail-closed, TENANT-106), Helm already hard-requires a key and now
  sets the require flag too. An explicit PROBECTL_ENVELOPE_KEY
  (KMS/secret-manager injected) always wins. The operator's duty to
  encrypt the BULK telemetry volumes (Postgres/ClickHouse/object store)
  is now a documented contract (docs/hardening.md §0c) enforced by the
  new `probectl-control preflight [--strict]`: it inspects the mounts
  backing the data paths, warns on undetectably-encrypted devices
  (strict = exit 1), and accepts a logged operator attestation for
  cloud-volume encryption invisible from inside a container.

- Sprint 7: ClickHouse queries are parameterized — every VALUE travels
  as a server-bound parameter ({name:Type} placeholder + param_* HTTP
  parameter, ClickHouse's native binding) instead of being escaped into
  the SQL text (ARCH-002, SEC-005, TENANT-108). The hand-rolled
  escaping helpers (chStr/chTime/sqlStr) are deleted across flowstore,
  pathstore, and the chmigrate ledger; tenant scoping is a bound
  parameter everywhere; DDL identifiers (CH users, table names) are
  regex-validated fail-closed since identifiers cannot be bound.
  Injection tests at three depths: SQL-builder unit tests (the raw
  value never appears in SQL), transport tests (param_* carries it),
  and a real-ClickHouse isolation case (a DROP-shaped tenant id selects
  nothing and breaks nothing). New `no-stringbuilt-sql` gate in make
  lint-go (self-testing) fails the build on reintroduced string-built
  CH SQL. FOUNDER DECISION: binding over the existing HTTP transport
  rather than adopting clickhouse-go/v2 — identical security property
  with no new dependency tree and the §4 architecture (breaker,
  silo router, TLS posture) intact.

- Sprint 6: cross-tenant isolation suite extended to the new ingest +
  query guarantees, end to end (TENANT-105 / TENANT-107). Ingest-path
  injection cases for every surface — flow (through real ClickHouse),
  device and eBPF/endpoint results (through the real, RLS-scoped
  registry binding on Postgres), and OTLP (token→tenant, capture sink):
  a client presenting tenant A's identity with payload tenant B is
  re-stamped to A or rejected and never lands in B's partition. The
  registry lookup that vouches for a (tenant, agent) pair is itself
  proven RLS-scoped (it cannot see another tenant's agent). Query-path:
  a non-service ClickHouse reader issuing a PREDICATE-FREE read sees only
  its own tenant's rows (the DB row policy, not the app WHERE, scopes it),
  with the Sprint 5 getSetting reader policy exercised where the server
  allows the custom-settings prefix. Siloed-namespace: a siloed tenant's
  records route ONLY to its namespaced topic — the shared topic never
  carries them — and a malformed namespace refuses construction
  (RED-006). The infra-bound cases run in the existing required
  cross-tenant-isolation CI job (no new plumbing); the silo-routing and
  OTLP cases need no infra and run in the normal suite too.

- Sprint 5: database-level tenant-isolation backstops. (TENANT-104)
  tenancy.AssertIsolationPosture runs at boot and FATALs if the app
  role is super/bypass-RLS or any tenant_id table lacks FORCE ROW
  LEVEL SECURITY — RLS-silently-off can no longer serve traffic;
  isolation suite proves it passes on a migrated DB and rejects an
  unforced table (non-vacuous). (TENANT-102) opt-in ClickHouse
  query-path scoping: tenant-scoped reads attach a per-request
  SQL_probectl_tenant custom setting and EnsureReaderRowPolicy binds a
  dedicated reader user's SELECTs to it (fail-closed when unset), so
  the pooled service account can be removed from the read path; the
  full threat model incl. the residual is in
  docs/security/tenant-isolation.md. (TENANT-106)
  PROBECTL_REQUIRE_AT_REST_ENCRYPTION makes keyless passthrough a fatal
  startup error instead of silent plaintext. All knobs default off
  (keyless dev still boots); enable in the hardened profiles.

- Sprint 4 [CRITICAL]: server-side tenant binding on ingest — the
  payload tenant_id is never authoritative again. Every bus-consumed
  plane (flow, device, eBPF-derived views, endpoint results, cost/
  compliance/topology views) verifies the claimed (tenant, agent) pair
  against the agents registry (RLS-scoped lookup, TTL-cached, FAIL
  CLOSED on mismatch/unknown/outage) and rejects mixed-identity
  batches; tenant-namespaced lanes are the authoritative tenant and
  overwrite payload disagreement (counted, logged). Emitters
  (flow/device/eBPF/endpoint) publish to their tenant's siloed lane
  when configured (PROBECTL_<PLANE>_BUS_NAMESPACE) and REFUSE START on
  a malformed namespace; bus.TopicFor now errors instead of silently
  falling back to the shared lane, and the results/RUM publishers drop
  (loudly) when silo routing is unavailable (TENANT-101, WIRE-001,
  TENANT-107, RED-006). Injection table tests + an end-to-end red-team
  test + FuzzVerifyBatchTenant guard it.

- Sprint 3 [CRITICAL]: the dev-mode auth bypass is COMPILED OUT of
  release binaries — the dev principal exists only behind -tags devauth
  (internal/control/devauth.go); release binaries refuse
  PROBECTL_AUTH_MODE=dev at boot, and even tagged builds require
  PROBECTL_DEV_AUTH_ACK=i-understand plus a loopback-only bind. Active
  dev auth logs at error level and writes an auth.dev_mode_active audit
  event. New required CI gate no-devauth-in-release verifies symbol +
  literal absence on the release binary, self-tests against a tagged
  build, and runs the behavioral boot refusal (RED-001, SEC-001;
  lineage U-001).

- Sprint 1: CI is a proven merge gate — committed branch ruleset
  (.github/rulesets/main.json) + CODEOWNERS + a verify-branch-protection
  job that fails on live-vs-committed drift (TEST-002, SUPPLY-007,
  CODE-007); the committed OIDC test key is gone — the mock IdP
  generates its key at test setup — and a pinned gitleaks secret-scan
  job gates every push/PR (CODE-006); coverage/test/scan outputs are
  retained as 90-day workflow artifacts with a PR coverage comment,
  documented in docs/quality/coverage.md (TEST-008, DATAROOM-005,
  DATAROOM-011); .gitignore asserted + docs/dev/repo-hygiene.md
  (CODE-003, triaged to gitignore-assert only).

- Sprint 0: observe-only denylist hardened — `bpf_probe_write_user` + the
  full state-mutating helper families forbidden (EBPF-006); known-risks
  register + finding-ID reconciliation map committed under
  `docs/diligence/` alongside the triaged sprint plan (DATAROOM-010
  pre-pay; triage verdicts in `docs/diligence/SPRINT-PLAN-TRIAGE.md`).
