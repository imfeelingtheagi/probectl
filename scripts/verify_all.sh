# verify-all (Sprint 25): the single executed-verification umbrella closing
# the diligence "STATIC-ONLY" methodology caveat. Runs build + vet/lint +
# race-detector tests + the repo guards + vulnerability/supply scans + the
# eBPF object compile, tee-ing EVERY output into receipts/ so diligence gets
# executed receipts, not static claims. Each step is BLOCKING (pipefail);
# a missing required tool FAILS the run — silently skipping a verification
# would recreate the exact gap this closes.
#
# Load + attach of the compiled BPF objects needs a kernel and runs in the
# ebpf-kernel-matrix CI job (QEMU, real LTS kernels) — the CI verify-all
# umbrella REQUIRES that job; locally this script proves the compile half
# when clang+bpftool are present.
