# LICENSE-003: stamp a machine-checkable SPDX tag on every first-party Go file
# so provenance is verifiable (the data-room "clean IP" prep).
#
# The tag VALUE is a PLACEHOLDER pending counsel's license choice (Appendix B
# of the remediation plan) — we deliberately do NOT invent a real OSI license.
# When counsel picks one, change CORE_TAG below and re-run: a single value-swap
# finalizes every header. The script is IDEMPOTENT — a file already carrying an
# SPDX-License-Identifier is skipped, so re-runs (and post-codegen runs) are safe.
#
# The tag is inserted as its OWN leading comment block followed by a blank line.
# Per `go help buildconstraint`, a //go:build constraint may be "preceded only
# by blank lines and other line comments", so this never breaks build tags; and
# the trailing blank line keeps it from being mistaken for the package doc.
