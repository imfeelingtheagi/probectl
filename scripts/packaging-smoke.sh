# packaging-smoke.sh (OPS-002) — build ONE deb + ONE rpm from a stand-in binary,
# exactly as release.yml does, and assert both artifacts appear with the NUMERIC
# package version. nfpm previously only ran at tag time, so a broken nfpm.yaml
# (the ${VAR}-in-src expansion bug + the v-prefix mismatch) shipped undetected.
# Running this on every PR makes the packaging path prove itself continuously.
