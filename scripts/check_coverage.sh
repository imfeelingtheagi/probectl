# Coverage gate: enforce a per-package statement-coverage floor from a Go cover
# profile (default coverage.out). A regression that drops a package below its
# floor fails CI.
#
# Scope: the pure-logic / parser / probe packages, whose meaningful coverage does
# NOT need external services. The stateful DB/transport packages (audit, tenancy,
# store/postgres, control, agent, agenttransport) are gated for *correctness* by
# the dedicated `integration` and `cross-tenant-isolation` CI jobs — a stronger
# guarantee than a coverage percentage — so they are not floored here. Generated
# code and not-yet-implemented placeholder packages are exempt.
#
# Floors are set a few points below the coverage measured in CI (the gate's
# environment — some privileged/raw-socket tests skip there), so ordinary refactors
# don't trip the gate while a real drop does. Local privileged runs read higher.
