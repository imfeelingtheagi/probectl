# Fuzz smoke (S15a hardening): run each fuzz target briefly to catch crashers.
#
# The gate's contract is "no crashers in the budget": a real finding makes
# `go test -fuzz` persist the failing input ("Failing input written to
# testdata/fuzz/<Target>/...") and we fail hard on that — or on any other
# real failure (panic, build error, vet error).
#
# One narrowly tolerated wart: on loaded CI runners the Go fuzz coordinator can
# report a bare "context deadline exceeded" when -fuzztime expires while a
# worker is mid-execution. That is a wind-down scheduling artifact, NOT a
# finding — but only when the run made real progress (it logged executions).
# TEST-007: we no longer blanket-tolerate the deadline. We tolerate it ONLY if
# the run actually executed inputs (an "elapsed: …, execs: N" line with N>0);
# a deadline with ZERO executions is a hang signature and FAILS. The single
# authoritative crasher signal (a persisted failing input) always fails, and
# the gate is NOT retried (a retry could mask a low-probability nondeterministic
# finding — RED/anti-vacuous-green discipline).
