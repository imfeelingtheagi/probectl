Self-hosted, source-available, multi-tenant **network observability platform**.
probectl unifies five observability planes — active/synthetic testing, BGP/routing
intelligence, flow analytics, device telemetry, and eBPF host/L7 — into one
**OpenTelemetry-native** control plane: OTel resource + network semantic
conventions describe every signal in every plane, and the platform ingests all
three OTLP signals — **metrics, traces, and logs** — bounded for correlation, and
re-exports its own signals as OTLP **metrics** ([docs/otlp.md](docs/otlp.md)).
Layered on top: an AI assistant for cross-plane root-cause analysis, a native
security/threat layer, change-aware topology, and cost/SLO intelligence.
Telemetry **never leaves the operator's network**.

One codebase serves two operating modes: **sovereign single-tenant** (a regulated
or air-gapped org self-hosts; the deployment *is* the tenant) and
**multi-tenant / provider** (an MSP self-hosts once and serves many hard-isolated,
white-labeled tenants). The single-tenant install is just the one-tenant case —
there is no separate code path. **Tenant is the outermost scope and security
boundary** on every record, agent, query, metric, event, and object.

## Why probectl

When something on the network breaks, the symptom and the cause usually live in
different places. A slow checkout page might be a BGP route flap three networks
away, a saturated uplink, a DNS timeout, a misbehaving host, or a config change
that shipped ten minutes ago — and the tools that each see one of those are
typically five separate products with five separate dashboards. You find out at
2 a.m., by stitching them together by hand.

probectl collapses that. It pulls every plane — synthetic probes, BGP/routing,
flow records, device telemetry, and eBPF host/L7 — into **one** tenant-scoped
control plane, correlates them into a single incident, and lets an AI assistant
explain the root cause *across* planes instead of leaving you to guess which
dashboard to open first.

Three choices set it apart:

- **It stays yours.** probectl is self-hosted and **never phones home** — no
  telemetry beacons, no "call home," nothing. Hosted observability SaaS works by
  shipping your network data to a vendor's cloud; probectl keeps every byte
  inside your own infrastructure. For regulated, air-gapped, or
  sovereignty-conscious operators, that isn't a nice-to-have — it's the
  requirement.
- **It's unified and standard.** One **OpenTelemetry-native** model spans all
  five planes, so a flow record, a probe result, and a BGP event share the same
  schema and the same query layer — no per-tool silos, and you can feed standard
  OTLP into it or hand its signals to your SIEM without re-instrumenting anything.
  (Scope: the schemas follow OTel resource + network semantic conventions
  everywhere; the receiver ingests all three OTLP signals — **metrics, traces,
  and logs** — bounded for correlation, and it re-exports probectl's own signals
  as OTLP **metrics**. See `docs/otlp.md`.)
- **It's multi-tenant to the core.** The same binary runs as a single sovereign
  tenant for one org, or as a hard-isolated, white-labeled, individually-metered
  platform an MSP self-hosts and resells. **Tenant is the outermost security
  boundary** on every record — there is no separate enterprise fork to drift out
  of sync.

## What it answers

probectl is organized around the questions operators actually ask at 2 a.m.:

- *"The Berlin office says the app is slow — is it the network, the path in
  between, or the server?"* — synthetic probes, ECMP/MPLS-aware path discovery,
  and flow show you **where** the latency is, not just that it exists.
- *"Did the 14:03 change cause this?"* — change-aware topology correlates
  config/deploy events with the symptoms that followed them.
- *"Why did this prefix go dark — is it us, or the internet?"* — BGP/routing
  intelligence from RouteViews/RIPE RIS, RPKI validity, and a collective outage
  view separate a you-problem from an everyone-problem.
- *"What breaks if I drain this node?"* — the topology **what-if** simulates the
  blast radius before you touch production.
- *"Who's saturating this link, and what's it costing?"* — flow analytics plus
  per-tenant FinOps egress attribution.

Or just ask the built-in assistant *"why is checkout slow for tenant X?"* — it
runs the cross-plane correlation and answers with **cited evidence**, scoped to
exactly what the caller is allowed to see. (The default engine is a
**deterministic, air-gapped heuristic** — no LLM is involved or contacted
unless you explicitly configure one; see the AI row below.)

## Who it's for

- **Regulated & sovereignty-conscious orgs** (finance, healthcare, public sector,
  defense, critical infrastructure) that need deep network observability but
  cannot send telemetry to a third-party cloud. You self-host; the deployment
  *is* your tenant.
- **MSPs & internal platform teams** serving many customers or business units —
  self-host once and serve hard-isolated, white-labeled, individually-metered
  tenants from one control plane.
- **Network & platform engineers** tired of hand-correlating five dashboards who
  want a single OTel-native source of truth they actually own (OTLP metrics,
  traces, and logs ingest — bounded for correlation, not an APM replacement).

## Capabilities

The five observability planes:

| Plane | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Active / synthetic** | canaries (ICMP/TCP/UDP/HTTP/DNS/…), ECMP/MPLS-aware path discovery, browser-synthetic checks, endpoint digital-experience monitoring |
| **BGP / routing** | RouteViews + RIPE RIS ingestion, route/path analysis, RPKI validity, a collective internet-outage view |
| **Flow analytics** | NetFlow / sFlow / IPFIX into ClickHouse, with per-tenant anomaly detection |
| **Device telemetry** | SNMP polling + gNMI streaming, folded into the topology graph |
| **eBPF host / L7** | service map + L7 visibility, observation-only (the Retina model). **Default builds replay recorded fixtures** (no kernel access needed — CI/macOS/demo path); live kernel capture is the separate `-tags ebpf` build on a BTF kernel ([build matrix](docs/ebpf-agent.md)) |

Intelligence, security, and platform layers built across the planes:

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **AI assistant** | cross-plane RCA grounded in correlated incidents, natural-language semantic query, AI test authoring, and an **MCP server** (read-only tools + a proposal-only remediation tool) — all **tenant- then RBAC-scoped**, with a fully air-gapped local-model path. **Default engine: a deterministic in-process heuristic (no LLM)** — connecting a model (local Ollama/vLLM or a cloud provider) is explicit opt-in ([`docs/ai-rca.md`](docs/ai-rca.md)) |
| **Topology** | a versioned, change-aware dependency graph with **what-if** impact simulation |
| **Security / threat** | TLS/cert posture + NDR-lite, **confidence-scored detections** (a signal exported to your SIEM — never an inline IPS) |
| **Cost / SLO** | FinOps egress-cost attribution, an OpenSLO engine, and segmentation/compliance validation with evidence |
| **Guarded remediation** | the AI **proposes** a fix grounded in RCA + a dry-run; a human **approves**; probectl **never executes** — proposal-only, blast-radius-limited, fully audited |
| **Multi-tenancy** | tenant is the outermost boundary; **pooled / siloed / hybrid** isolation, selectable per deployment and per tenant |
| **Provider / MSP plane** | tenant lifecycle, fleet-across-tenants, per-tenant metering + quotas, white-label branding, and audited break-glass (no implicit access to tenant telemetry) |
| **Sovereignty & crypto** | no phone-home, mTLS/SPIFFE agent identity, envelope encryption, per-tenant **BYOK**, per-tenant export + verifiable erasure, and an optional build against the **FIPS 140-3-validated Go Cryptographic Module** (CMVP cert **#5247**; probectl itself holds no product-level certificate — see [`docs/hardening.md`](docs/hardening.md)) |

## How it works

Lightweight **agents** — a single Go binary, each bound to one tenant — run the
probes and watch the wire, then push results onto a **bus**. The stateless
**control plane** consumes that stream, persists each signal to the store that
fits it (Postgres for state, ClickHouse for high-cardinality events,
Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics for metrics), and continuously builds incidents and a
versioned topology graph. Every record, query, metric, and message is scoped by
`tenant_id` **first**, then by your RBAC — so the API, web UI, AI assistant, and
MCP server all read through the same tenant-then-RBAC boundary, and a query
cannot cross a tenant line even by mistake.

External intelligence (RouteViews, RIPE RIS/Atlas, RPKI, threat-intel, cloud
pricing) is fetched **once**, cached, and enriched per tenant; if a feed is
rate-limited or down, that view degrades gracefully instead of taking the
platform with it.

The provider/management plane spans tenants for **operations only** — never for
silent data access; any access is explicit, time-bounded, tenant-consented, and
separately audited. Full data-flow and per-subsystem diagrams live in
**[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)**.

## What probectl is not

It's a **signal layer, not an enforcement layer**. Threat detections are
confidence-scored and exported to your SIEM — probectl does **not** inline-block
traffic or act as an IPS. The AI **proposes** remediations; a human approves and
an operator acts — there is **no autonomous execution**. And it complements,
rather than replaces, a full APM/distributed-tracing stack or a SIEM/log-analytics
platform. probectl is honest about its edges by design.

## Editions

The full five-plane platform — all observability, the AI assistant, security/threat,
topology, cost/SLO, and single-tenant self-hosting — is **core, and free**.
Commercial code lives in a **publicly-readable `ee/` tree** (the fence is the
license + trademark, not source secrecy) and is gated at runtime by an
**offline-verifiable, signed license** that **never phones home**. **Enterprise**
adds the validated-module (FIPS) build, BYOK/governance, multi-region HA, and guarded remediation;
**Provider/MSP** adds the management plane, hard tenant isolation, metering/billing,
and white-label. Unlicensed commercial features are simply hidden (no lockware).
See **[`docs/editions.md`](docs/editions.md)**.

## Quickstart (run it)

**One idea first: the control plane is a *consumer*, not a producer.** It
ingests, correlates, stores, and serves — but it never observes the network
itself. The things that watch the wire and run probes are the **producers**:
the agents and collectors. So a control plane with **no producers attached
collects nothing** — `/readyz` goes green and the dashboards stay empty. That's
expected, not a bug. To see data you have to attach at least one producer.

### Fastest path to *first data* — the evaluation stack

This brings up the control plane **plus** an eBPF agent in **fixture mode**
(replaying a recorded, clearly-labelled file of SAMPLE flows — no kernel, works
on macOS/Windows/Linux), so you watch a real signal flow end-to-end with one
command and no Go toolchain:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/eval.yml up --build -d
# ~20s for the control plane to migrate + start, then:
docker compose -f deploy/compose/eval.yml --profile tools run --rm viewer
```

`viewer` prints the `/v1/topology` service map the control plane folded out of
those sample flows — that JSON **is your first data**. This stack is
**evaluation-only** (loopback dev-auth — every request is an unauthenticated
admin — plus plaintext Kafka and a self-signed cert), so it's never reachable
from your network and never for production. Walk it all the way through —
including synthetic (canary) probes and the build-from-source path — in
**[`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md)**, and meet every
producer you can attach in **[`docs/deploying-agents.md`](docs/deploying-agents.md)**.

### Production-shaped stack

The shipped all-in-one deploy is `deploy/compose/probectl.yml`: the control
plane **over HTTPS** with a bundled Postgres (a self-signed cert is generated on
first boot), no evaluation weakenings.

```sh
cp deploy/compose/.env.example deploy/compose/.env     # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD (required) + PROBECTL_ENVELOPE_KEY
docker compose -f deploy/compose/probectl.yml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/probectl.yml cp control:/certs/ca.crt ./ca.crt
curl --cacert ./ca.crt https://localhost:8443/readyz
```

Once `/readyz` is green, open the UI at `https://localhost:8443` — then (per the
consumer/producer rule above) register an agent and run your first synthetic
test, or ask the assistant a question. The API is HTTPS-only (no plaintext
port). Full guide, real certificates, SSO, and the Kubernetes/Helm path:
**[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md)**; day-2 operation (audit, roles, SSO):
**[`docs/admin.md`](docs/admin.md)**.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: **Go 1.26+**, **Docker** (with Buildx) for the dev stack and
images, and **Python 3.12+** for the analyzer tooling.

```sh
make build          # build all binaries into ./bin
make test           # unit tests across the workspace
make lint           # gofmt + go vet + golangci-lint, and ruff + black
make compose-up     # start the dev dependency stack (Postgres/Kafka/ClickHouse/Prometheus)
make run            # run probectl-control locally
make help           # list every target
```

## Contributing

Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Commits follow **Conventional
Commits** (enforced by commitlint in CI) and carry a **DCO sign-off**
(`git commit -s`). Before pushing, run `make ci` — it runs the linters, the unit
tests, and the cross-tenant isolation gate, the same checks CI enforces on every
pull request. The non-negotiable rules (tenant isolation, no phone-home, crypto
only through `internal/crypto`, TLS on every listener) are summarized in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and enforced by standing CI gates.
