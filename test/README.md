# test/

Integration / end-to-end test harness.

These are **black-box** tests: they drive the running services only through
their public doors (REST, gRPC, the bus) against the real dev stack defined in
[`deploy/compose/dev.yml`](../deploy/compose/dev.yml) — Postgres, Kafka,
ClickHouse, and Prometheus (services and ports:
[`deploy/compose/README.md`](../deploy/compose/README.md)) — rather than
importing `internal/` packages. That restriction is the value: a black-box
test can only pass if the *deployed* interfaces work, so it cannot be fooled
by an internal shortcut a unit test might take.

```
test/
├── integration/   # build-tagged `integration` black-box tests
└── e2e/           # full-stack end-to-end test (real binaries + public API)
```

## Why a separate module

`test/` is its own Go module (`github.com/imfeelingtheagi/probectl/test`) tied
into the workspace via `go.work`. This keeps heavy, test-only dependencies
(Kafka/ClickHouse/Postgres drivers, testcontainers, …) out of the main module's
`go.mod`/`go.sum` — anyone importing probectl's main module never inherits
them.

## Running

```sh
make test-integration   # go test -tags=integration across modules (needs the dev stack up)
make e2e                # PROBECTL_E2E=1 full-stack e2e (compose deps + real binaries; nightly CI)
```

The integration tests are build-tagged `integration` (a build tag is a
compile-time label — files marked `//go:build integration` are invisible to a
plain `go test`), so they never run during the default `make test`. The e2e
test (`test/e2e`, `TestE2E`) brings up the compose dependencies, runs the real
binaries, and asserts the public API and the **cross-tenant boundary** (no
bleed in either direction); it is skipped unless `PROBECTL_E2E=1` is set.

The unit-level **cross-tenant isolation** gate is separate — `make
test-isolation` runs the `isolation`-tagged suite across the main module, with
`internal/tenancy/` as the enforcement choke point. Both exist for the same
non-negotiable: see
[CONTRIBUTING.md → Non-negotiables](../CONTRIBUTING.md#non-negotiables).
