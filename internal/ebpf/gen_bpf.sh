#
# Called by `make ebpf-agent`, deploy/docker/Dockerfile.ebpf, the ci.yml eBPF
# jobs, and `go generate ./internal/ebpf/...`. Keeping ONE bpf2go invocation
# here — rather than five near-identical copies — is deliberate: the vendored
# -I/header flags and the arch_compat opt-out below live in exactly one place,
# so a build change touches one file instead of drifting across many.
#
# Precondition: internal/ebpf/bpf/vmlinux.h is already dumped from the build
# host's BTF. The caller does that (the bpftool invocation differs per env —
# e.g. ci.yml locates a linux-tools-generic binary), so this script does not.
#
# Usage: gen_bpf.sh [l4flow|sslsniff|all] [sslsniff_target_arch]
#   - selector defaults to "all"
#   - sslsniff_target_arch defaults to the host's $(go env GOARCH); the
#     Dockerfile cross-build passes ${TARGETARCH} explicitly.
