# Vendored libbpf BPF-program headers

These are the **BPF-side** headers from [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf),
vendored — copied into this tree at a pinned upstream version — so the eBPF
object compile (`bpf2go` → clang) does **not** depend on whatever `libbpf-dev`
version the build image or CI runner happens to ship.

Why: `sslsniff.bpf.c` uses `BPF_UPROBE`/`BPF_URETPROBE`, which libbpf only added
in **v1.2.0**. The Debian-bookworm-based build image originally pulled in distro
libbpf **1.1.0**, which lacks those macros — so the compile failed. Vendoring a
pinned header set removes that whole class of version-skew breakage; today the
build image (`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.ebpf`) installs no `libbpf-dev` at all
and compiles exclusively against these headers.

- Source: https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf
- Version: **v1.5.0**
- Commit: `09b9e83102eb8ab9e540d36b4559c55f3bcdb95d`
- Obtained via: `make install_headers` at that tag (then copied the BPF-program subset).
- License: LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-2-Clause (per each file's SPDX header).

The files live in the `bpf/` subdirectory here (`headers/bpf/`), so the programs
include them with the upstream path — `#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>`. The BPF
compile reaches them via `-I./bpf/headers` in `gen_bpf.sh` (the single source of
truth for the clang/`bpf2go` build; a `gen_bpf_test.go` guard fails the build if
that flag is dropped).

Files (BPF-program headers only; the userspace loader headers are intentionally
NOT vendored — the Go side uses the `github.com/cilium/ebpf` library):

| file (`headers/bpf/`) | included by                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| bpf_helpers.h         | l4flow.bpf.c, sslsniff.bpf.c         |
| bpf_helper_defs.h     | (via bpf_helpers.h)                  |
| bpf_tracing.h         | sslsniff.bpf.c (BPF_UPROBE)          |
| bpf_core_read.h       | available for CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) reads |
| bpf_endian.h          | available for byte-order helpers     |

## Updating

Re-run `make install_headers` at the desired libbpf tag and copy the same five
files here; bump the Version/Commit above. Keep the floor at **>= v1.2.0**
(first release with BPF_UPROBE/BPF_URETPROBE).

Both invariants are executable, not aspirational: `vendored_headers_test.go`
(an ordinary unit test — no clang or kernel needed) fails if any of the five
files goes missing or if `bpf_tracing.h` no longer defines
`BPF_UPROBE`/`BPF_URETPROBE`, i.e. if the vendored set ever regresses below the
v1.2.0 floor.
