// BatchingWriter coalesces concurrent Write calls into one underlying
// remote-write request (SCALE-001). The ingest hot path did one Prometheus
// remote-write HTTP POST PER probe result; under a fleet that is a POST per
// message. This wrapper merges the series from all Writes that arrive within a
// small window (or until a series cap) into a single WriteRequest — far fewer,
// larger POSTs — while preserving PER-CALLER error attribution: every Write
// blocks until its batch flushes and returns THAT batch's result, so the result
// pipeline still dead-letters exactly the messages whose write failed
// (per-message DLQ attribution intact). With one writer goroutine it just adds
// up to maxWait latency; the win shows when the bus workers write concurrently.
