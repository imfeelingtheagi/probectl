// Package a2a is the control-plane broker for agent-to-agent measurement
// sessions (S8). It assigns roles (one agent responds, the other initiates),
// rendezvouses the responder's listen endpoint to the initiator, and hands each
// agent its task when it polls. All state is tenant-scoped: an agent only ever
// receives tasks queued for its own (tenant, agent) identity, and only a
// session's responder — in the session's tenant — may report an endpoint, so a
// session can never cross a tenant boundary (CLAUDE.md §7 guardrail 1).
//
// State is in-memory for S8; the trigger to start a session is wired to the
// test/probe API in a later sprint.
